> In 2003, nearly five years before [Nakamoto's *magnum opus*](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), my co-authors and I won a "best paper" award at the prestigious SOSP workshop for [*Preserving Peer Replicas By Rate-Limited Sampled Voting*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/945445.945451). It described a decentralized consensus system using voting among peers and proof-of-work, the protocol underlying the [LOCKSS system](https://www.lockss.org/). It doesn't rate a mention from Narayanan and Clark because its innovations weren't relevant to cryptocurrencies, but it illustrates the way these techniques were well-known in the computer science field.
