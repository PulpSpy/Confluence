# TA Marking Guide

In becoming a TA, I will do the following (but might need reminders):

1) Add you to Slack so we can talk easily
2) Add you to Moodle so you can see the course and its content

Here are some general guidelines for marking assignments (especially for the first time):

* We now use Moodle for receiving assignments and for entering grades and returning the grades to the students.
* My advice is to mark the assignments question-by-question (as opposed to marking the entire assignment from one student, and then the entire assignment from the next student). If you mark all of question 1 across the assignments, you more quickly see the patterns in how students respond and what issues there might be. It is also easier to focus on one question at a time. 
* It is ok for the class average on assignments to be high (or near perfect). Exams and projects will be the tool that separates good students from average students, assignments are just to get the students working directly with the concepts. 
* With that in mind, start with assumption that an assignment is perfect and deduct marks from the perfect score if there are issues. Have a clear set of issues and how many marks you think the deduction merits.
* Students will fight with you over every mark and so you can save yourself trouble if you have a clear-cut deduction.
* If you backtrack on a deduction, the student will tell their friends and their friends will ask for the same thing (or think they are asking for the same thing without realizing their deduction is different). This is fine, it is fair in fact, but the best is to try and not put yourself in a position of needing to deal with this. Have clear-cut deductions and stick to them if they are fair.
* In terms of feedback, enter the grade. The written feedback can be very short and point form, mainly it just communicates the reason for any deduction (perfect grades do not require feedback). Last, include your name and how you want students to contact you with questions (easiest is to say use Moodle).
* If there is a dispute, I will trust you. You marked 100 assignments, you know what good answers and average answers look like. However if you cannot reach a resolution with a student, please let me know.
* If students are hostile in any way, please let me know as well.
* Marking is hard work, it is super boring, and it takes a LOT of time, especially with 100 students. Make sure you give yourself enough time, try to break it into smaller chunks (mark a question on one day, mark a different question on a different day), and you can skim answers looking for clear-cut issues without reading and processing every word.
* Generally, we like to get marks back within 2 weeks of the assignment due date. If you need longer, please communicate with me.
* Last, if you see ways of marking the assignment easier to mark or better in general, please let me know and I am happy to progress the quality of the assignment. 
* Ask me anything, any time. I can also connect you with past TAs in most cases.
