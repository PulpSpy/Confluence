**Crypto Fraud**



Ponzi scheme

- It is a bubble



Pyramid scheme

- Alice tells Bob about BTC
- Bob buys BTC
- Alice profits?



The House

- Easy Money by Ben McKenzie and Jacob Silverman
- Gambling
  - Zero sum: Alice makes money by Bob losing
  - (Not true, crypto might all go up or down)
  - Easiest way a skeptic would even agree is that if all crypto crashed and burned tomorrow, does that mean someone had to have gotten super rich? Of course not, it is not zero sum.
  - Playing poker
    - Argument
      - Nothing of value has been created
      - Zero sum
      - Players pay fees (exchange and gas) = “the rake”
      - Average gambler will lose, the house will win
      - Casinos is heavily regulated, crypto is not and has little entertainment value (drinks, theatre, comps) 
    - Critique
      - Anything that takes a fee is the same
      - Casino poker is not like most casino games, house just facilities the game for a fee rather than actively participates as a counter-party to your bets
