# **Crypto Fraud**

I often hear Bitcoin described by skeptics as a big "ponzi" scheme or "pyramid" scheme. Technically, it is neither. That does not mean Bitcoin isn't some kind of fraud or bad thing, it just means it is not specifically a Ponzi or Pyramid. 

I prefer to think in terms of a "bubble." In a bubble, herd mentality drives price up and then they crash, but the crash is not to zero like in a fraud. Housing prices underwent a bubble around 2008 and crashed, however that does not mean houses are worthless or the housing market is a fraud. It just means things were overvalued.

Notes on Easy Money by Ben McKenzie and Jacob Silverman

- Gambling
  - Zero sum: Alice makes money by Bob losing
  - (Not true, crypto might all go up or down)
  - Easiest way a skeptic would even agree is that if all crypto crashed and burned tomorrow, does that mean someone had to have gotten super rich? Of course not, it is not zero sum.
  - Playing poker
    - Argument
      - Nothing of value has been created
      - Zero sum
      - Players pay fees (exchange and gas) = “the rake”
      - Average gambler will lose, the house will win
      - Casinos is heavily regulated, crypto is not and has little entertainment value (drinks, theatre, comps) 
    - Critique
      - Anything that takes a fee is the same
      - Casino poker is not like most casino games, house just facilities the game for a fee rather than actively participates as a counter-party to your bets
