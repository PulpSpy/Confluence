Basic Math

Sets, Mappings, etc





== Sets



Set: {a,b,c}

Multiset: {a,a,b,c,c,c}

Sequence: (a,b,c,d)

k-tuple: (a,b,c,d) 		(Finite sequence)

Power set: {Null, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {b,c}, {a,c}, {a,b,c}} 	(of {a,b,c})



== Mappings



Function: y=f(x) 		(mapping)

k-ary function: y=f(x1,x2,x3,x4)



Predicate: {T,F}=R(x) 		(unary relation)

k-ary relation: {T,F}=R(x1,x2,x3,x4)



Domain: x	(pre-image)

Range: y 	(co-domain, image)



Function: each y has a unique x 	(single-valued function)

Total: each x is mapped from 		(preimage = domain)

Injective: each x has unique y		(image = range)

Surjective: each y is mapped to 		(onto)

Bijective function: all of the above	(if domain=range then permutation)



Mappings that are not functions are sometimes called multi-valued functions (same x could map to y1 or y2)



Relations can also be defined as sets. For example,

"beats": {(Scissors, Papers),(Paper,Rock),(Rock,Scissors)}



Reflexive: xRx

Symmetric: xRy implies yRx

Transitive: xRy and yRz implies xRz 



Support: set of inputs for which outputs are non-zero ( x | f(x) != 0 )
