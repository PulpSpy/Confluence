Quebec is a strange place sometimes:

* Quebec child protection laws are unique so tech companies like Google just ban kid accounts and YouTube kids.
* Shortages. For example, currently license plates. Worst was children's Advil and Tylenol. We border the USA but we cannot import from the USA because of language laws.
* Board games can only be sold in English if there is also a French version available. The French version has to be the same price or less than the English version. Since French versions are a niche market, the English ones will get marked up so much, no one would ever buy them when they could just order on Amazon for less. So no one stocks English games.
