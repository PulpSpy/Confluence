## FFTs for Cryptographers

### Background

I remember sitting, jet-legged and tired, on a balmy Italian summer day in a castle in Bertinoro for a three day workshop on cryptographic voting schemes. Jens Groth was giving a talk on proving permutations of ciphertextâ€”the crypto equivalent of shuffling up a box of ballots before counting the vote. Many slides after I was already lost, he introduced a technique using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). I blinked twice making sure it said what it said. I had flash backs to electrical engineering courses I took as an undergraduate. Now that I worked in cryptography, I thought I'd never see an FFT again, along with all the vector calculus and VLSI circuit layouts. But there it was. Now I just needed to figure out what FFTs had to do with crypto?

The truth is that most cryptographers are not using Fourier transforms because they are Fourier transforms, with the exception of maybe some use-cases like image transformation or signal processing under encryption. Cryptographers are instead using it as means to an end. The end is manipulating polynomials under encryption (or commitment or secret sharing... some obfuscation technique). 

As a reminder, polynomials have three representations that we tend to use. 

1. I might tell you all the coefficients of the polynomial
2. I might tell you enough points on the polynomial that you can draw a curve through them and determine the polynomial
3. I might tell you enough roots (points of intersection with the x-axis) that you can recover the polynomial

We also sometimes want to shift between the representations. FFT will help for transitions between (1) and (2).

### "For cryptographers"

Polynomials, interpolation, and Fourier transforms are all big topics that have general theories and applications. This article will not try to explain anything in its full generality. Instead we will simplify as much as possible, limiting ourselves to only what we need for many cryptographic applications.

Here are the simplifications:

1) We only use integers. No real numbers. No imaginary numbers.
2) Integers are from a bounded range: $[0,q-1]$ or $\mathbb{Z}_q$ for a large (e.g., 256 bit) prime $q$.
3) Polynomials are univariate (only one variable)



### Worked Example: Evaluation

Assume $q=97$.

We will start with the more intuitive direction: going from a polynomial in coefficient form to a set of points on the polynomial. Consider the following polynomial in coefficient form:
$$
P(\square)=81 \square^7+57 \square^6+11 \square^5+59 \square^4+60 \square^3+83 \square^2+45 \square+44
$$
In this case, the list of coefficients (from least to greatest) is $\{44,45,83,60,59,11,57,81\}$. The degree of the polynomial is 7 and the number of coefficients is 8. Our goal is determine 8 unique points of form ($x_i, y_i=P(x_i))$. Why 8? We need 8 points to fully determine a degree 7 polynomial, so this will let us reverse the process (go from points to coefficients) in the future if need to. 

(Remark: Think of a straight line. It is of form $P(\square)=c_1\square+c_0$ which is degree $1$ with $2$ coefficients. You need $2$ points to figure out what the line should be. Generalizing, for a degree $d$ polynomial, $d+1$ coefficients or $d+1$ points are needed to fully determine it.)

So the goal is to find $8$ points on the polynomial $P(\square)$. The points can be at any x-coordinates so we will chose $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ for now. We call this the *domain*. Finding the points is a simple as plugging the x-coordinates into the $P(\square)$ equation:  
$$
P(\boxed{1})=81 \boxed{1}^7+57 \boxed{1}^6+11 \boxed{1}^5+59 \boxed{1}^4+60 \boxed{1}^3+83 \boxed{1}^2+45 \boxed{1}+44=52 \\

P(\boxed{2})=81 \boxed{2}^7+57 \boxed{2}^6+11 \boxed{2}^5+59 \boxed{2}^4+60 \boxed{2}^3+83 \boxed{2}^2+45 \boxed{2}+44=59 \\

P(\boxed{3})=81 \boxed{3}^7+57 \boxed{3}^6+11 \boxed{3}^5+59 \boxed{3}^4+60 \boxed{3}^3+83 \boxed{3}^2+45 \boxed{3}+44=69 \\

P(\boxed{4})=81 \boxed{4}^7+57 \boxed{4}^6+11 \boxed{4}^5+59 \boxed{4}^4+60 \boxed{4}^3+83 \boxed{4}^2+45 \boxed{4}+44=81 \\

P(\boxed{5})=81 \boxed{5}^7+57 \boxed{5}^6+11 \boxed{5}^5+59 \boxed{5}^4+60 \boxed{5}^3+83 \boxed{5}^2+45 \boxed{5}+44=12 \\

P(\boxed{6})=81 \boxed{6}^7+57 \boxed{6}^6+11 \boxed{6}^5+59 \boxed{6}^4+60 \boxed{6}^3+83 \boxed{6}^2+45 \boxed{6}+44=15 \\

P(\boxed{7})=81 \boxed{7}^7+57 \boxed{7}^6+11 \boxed{7}^5+59 \boxed{7}^4+60 \boxed{7}^3+83 \boxed{7}^2+45 \boxed{7}+44=92 \\

P(\boxed{8})=81 \boxed{8}^7+57 \boxed{8}^6+11 \boxed{8}^5+59 \boxed{8}^4+60 \boxed{8}^3+83 \boxed{8}^2+45 \boxed{8}+44=36 \\
$$


In more succinct form, we are moving between a list of 8 coefficients and a list of 8 points on the polynomial.
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 44 & 45 & 83 & 60 & 59 & 11 & 57 & 81 \\
\end{array}
\right)
\leftrightarrow
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
 52 & 59 & 69 & 81 & 12 & 15 & 92 & 36 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
Before figuring out how to go backward, we are going redo the same thing one more time, this time using matrix notation. The equivalent computation we just did is the following:


$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 \boxed{1}^0 & \boxed{1}^1 & \boxed{1}^2 & \boxed{1}^3 & \boxed{1}^4 & \boxed{1}^5 & \boxed{1}^6 & \boxed{1}^7\\
 \boxed{2}^0 & \boxed{2}^1 & \boxed{2}^2 & \boxed{2}^3 & \boxed{2}^4 & \boxed{2}^5 & \boxed{2}^6 & \boxed{2}^7\\
 \boxed{3}^0 & \boxed{3}^1 & \boxed{3}^2 & \boxed{3}^3 & \boxed{3}^4 & \boxed{3}^5 & \boxed{3}^6 & \boxed{3}^7\\
 \boxed{4}^0 & \boxed{4}^1 & \boxed{4}^2 & \boxed{4}^3 & \boxed{4}^4 & \boxed{4}^5 & \boxed{4}^6 & \boxed{4}^7\\

 \boxed{8}^0 & \boxed{8}^1 & \boxed{8}^2 & \boxed{8}^3 & \boxed{8}^4 & \boxed{8}^5 & \boxed{8}^6 & \boxed{8}^7\\

#### Efficiency

Let's pause for a moment and think about efficiency. First, consider the matrix: it does not depend on the polynomial values at all. It only depends on the *domain* (or set of x-values) that you want to evaluate the points at. The domain can be decided ahead of time (e.g., we will always use a domain of 1, 2, 3, ...) and then the matrix can be computed at that time. From a protocol perspective, the matrix can be pre-computed and can be shared between operations on polynomials of the same degree.

The multiplication is clearly $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of coefficients/evaluation points. The whole point of FFT to reduce the work to $O(n \cdot \log_2{n})$ and that is it. In a world where efficiency is not a concern, you can just do the above and ignore FFT.

#### Cryptography

Moving back to cryptography, imagine you have the polynomial in encrypted (or committed or secret shared) form and this encryption is additively homomorphic. To compute the evaluation points under encryption only involves multiplying in known values from the matrix (which are not secret and depend only on the domain), and then doing additions under encryption. Therefore we can evaluate (and, as you will see below, interpolate) under encryption. Sometimes doing things on the points of a polynomial is simpler than on the polynomials themselves (e.g., multiplying polynomials were you only care about a subset of the points on the polynomial). And vice-versa (rotating an array of values: if encode values into a set of polynomial points, interpolate it, multiply in some constants into the polynomial coefficients, and convert back to points, the array will be rotated). 

#### Jargon

A matrix with the above form is called a Vandermonde matrix. This process is called a discrete Fourier transform (or DFT). FFT is a special case of DFT and is faster. 



### Worked Example: Interpolation

Now assume we have a set of points and want to go backwards to determine the coefficients:
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
 52 & 59 & 69 & 81 & 12 & 15 & 92 & 36 \\
\end{array}
\right)
\rightarrow
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 44 & 45 & 83 & 60 & 59 & 11 & 57 & 81 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
Placing the evaluation process into matrix multiplication makes interpolation very easy to understand. We simply move the matrix to the other side of the equation, which involves inverting it. Above, we did the following (coefficients to points):
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 & 16 & 32 & 64 & 31 \\
 1 & 3 & 9 & 27 & 81 & 49 & 50 & 53 \\
 1 & 4 & 16 & 64 & 62 & 54 & 22 & 88 \\
 1 & 5 & 25 & 28 & 43 & 21 & 8 & 40 \\
 1 & 6 & 36 & 22 & 35 & 16 & 96 & 91 \\
 1 & 7 & 49 & 52 & 73 & 26 & 85 & 13 \\
 1 & 8 & 64 & 27 & 22 & 79 & 50 & 12 \\
\end{array}
\right)

\cdot

\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 44 \\
 45 \\
 83 \\
 60 \\
 59 \\
 11 \\
 57 \\
 81 \\
\end{array}
\right)

 =
 
 \left(
\begin{array}{c}
 52 \\
 59 \\
 69 \\
 81 \\
 12 \\
 15 \\
 92 \\
 36 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
To do interpolation (points to coefficients), we move the matrix to the other side of the equation:
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 44 \\
 45 \\
 83 \\
 60 \\
 59 \\
 11 \\
 57 \\
 81 \\
\end{array}
\right)

 =
 
 \left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 & 16 & 32 & 64 & 31 \\
 1 & 3 & 9 & 27 & 81 & 49 & 50 & 53 \\
 1 & 4 & 16 & 64 & 62 & 54 & 22 & 88 \\
 1 & 5 & 25 & 28 & 43 & 21 & 8 & 40 \\
 1 & 6 & 36 & 22 & 35 & 16 & 96 & 91 \\
 1 & 7 & 49 & 52 & 73 & 26 & 85 & 13 \\
 1 & 8 & 64 & 27 & 22 & 79 & 50 & 12 \\
\end{array}
\right)^{-1}

\cdot

 \left(
\begin{array}{c}
 52 \\
 59 \\
 69 \\
 81 \\
 12 \\
 15 \\
 92 \\
 36 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
Solving the inverse matrix, we arrive at:
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 44 \\
 45 \\
 83 \\
 60 \\
 59 \\
 11 \\
 57 \\
 81 \\
\end{array}
\right)

 =
 
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 8 & 69 & 56 & 27 & 56 & 69 & 8 & 96 \\
 50 & 33 & 54 & 3 & 53 & 10 & 57 & 31 \\
 7 & 70 & 8 & 86 & 20 & 39 & 76 & 82 \\
 47 & 89 & 24 & 11 & 90 & 12 & 37 & 78 \\
 85 & 57 & 80 & 34 & 90 & 63 & 71 & 5 \\
 55 & 85 & 43 & 77 & 2 & 67 & 91 & 65 \\
 64 & 11 & 45 & 86 & 44 & 12 & 22 & 7 \\
 73 & 71 & 78 & 64 & 33 & 19 & 26 & 24 \\
\end{array}
\right)

\cdot

 \left(
\begin{array}{c}
 52 \\
 59 \\
 69 \\
 81 \\
 12 \\
 15 \\
 92 \\
 36 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
Can we always invert the matrix? The answer is yes, assuming each row of the matrix is unique, which is to say, each evaluation point is unique (no repeats). The complexity analysis is the same as evaluation: the matrix can be pre-computed and the multiplication is $O(n^2)$. The FFT trick will work equally well on this matrix.

#### Jargon

This process is called the inverse discrete Fourier transform (or iDFT). If each column of the matrix is taken to be a coefficient list of a polynomial, such polynomials are called Lagrange polynomials.

### Speeding up evaluation and interpolation

#### Divide-and-conquer

The high level idea of speeding up both processes is called divide-and-conquer. Recall this equation:


$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 & 16 & 32 & 64 & 31 \\
 1 & 3 & 9 & 27 & 81 & 49 & 50 & 53 \\
 1 & 4 & 16 & 64 & 62 & 54 & 22 & 88 \\
 1 & 5 & 25 & 28 & 43 & 21 & 8 & 40 \\
 1 & 6 & 36 & 22 & 35 & 16 & 96 & 91 \\
 1 & 7 & 49 & 52 & 73 & 26 & 85 & 13 \\
 1 & 8 & 64 & 27 & 22 & 79 & 50 & 12 \\
\end{array}
\right)

\cdot

\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 44 \\
 45 \\
 83 \\
 60 \\
 59 \\
 11 \\
 57 \\
 81 \\
\end{array}
\right)

 =
 
 \left(
\begin{array}{c}
 52 \\
 59 \\
 69 \\
 81 \\
 12 \\
 15 \\
 92 \\
 36 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
What if we split this up? For example, say we find the evaluation at $\{1,2,3,4\}$ using the first four coefficients $\{44,45,83,60\}$, then we find the evaluation at $\{5,6,7,8\}$ using the last four coefficients $\{59,11,57,81\}$:
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 \\
 1 & 3 & 9 & 27 \\
 1 & 4 & 16 & 64 \\
\end{array}
\right)

\cdot

\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 44 \\
 45 \\
 83 \\
 60 \\
\end{array}
\right)

 =
 
 \left(
\begin{array}{c}
 38 \\
 73 \\
 24 \\
 57 \\
\end{array}
\right)

\\

\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & 5 & 25 & 28 \\
 1 & 6 & 36 & 22 \\
 1 & 7 & 49 & 52 \\
 1 & 8 & 64 & 27 \\
\end{array}
\right)

\cdot

\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 59 \\
 11 \\
 57 \\
 81 \\
\end{array}
\right)

 =
 
 \left(
\begin{array}{c}
 24 \\
 79 \\
 60 \\
 65 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
Next, we need some way to *combine* $\{38,73,24,57\}$ and $\{24, 79, 60, 65\}$ to generate $\{52,59,69,81,12,15,92,36\}$ (that does not add a bunch more work). Assume we can pull this off, then we can recurse using this trick. Instead of directly computing the above two equations (involving two 4x4 matricies), we can split each of them into 2x2 matrices (for a total of four) using the same process. There is just one problem: there isn't a simple algorithm for the *combine* step (faster than just computing the entire original matrix) that is going to work for us.

#### One parameter we can change

Reconsider the original problem, moving between coefficients (left) and evaluation points (right):
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 44 & 45 & 83 & 60 & 59 & 11 & 57 & 81 \\
\end{array}
\right)
\leftrightarrow
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
 52 & 59 & 69 & 81 & 12 & 15 & 92 & 36 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
We cannot control the coefficients of the polynomial â€” they are what they are. What the polynomial evaluates to at $\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ is also what it is, we cannot control it. However the one thing we did get to choose is $\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ itself (which we call the domain). We can map between coefficients and any domain, assuming there are 8 unique evaluation points. They do not have to be these specific points. So the question is, are there a different set of points that are "nicer" to deal with than $\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$?

The domain shows up in the second column of the matrix:
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 & 16 & 32 & 64 & 31 \\
 1 & 3 & 9 & 27 & 81 & 49 & 50 & 53 \\
 1 & 4 & 16 & 64 & 62 & 54 & 22 & 88 \\
 1 & 5 & 25 & 28 & 43 & 21 & 8 & 40 \\
 1 & 6 & 36 & 22 & 35 & 16 & 96 & 91 \\
 1 & 7 & 49 & 52 & 73 & 26 & 85 & 13 \\
 1 & 8 & 64 & 27 & 22 & 79 & 50 & 12 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
What if we make the points (the second column) the same values as the second row of the table: a domain of $\{1,2,4,8,16,32,64,31\}$? In this case, we will get a symmetric matrix which is a little "nicer" than one that is asymmetric. We will show both the matrix (using for evaluation) and its inverse (used for interpolation):
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 & 16 & 32 & 64 & 31 \\
 1 & 4 & 16 & 64 & 62 & 54 & 22 & 88 \\
 1 & 8 & 64 & 27 & 22 & 79 & 50 & 12 \\
 1 & 16 & 62 & 22 & 61 & 6 & 96 & 81 \\
 1 & 32 & 54 & 79 & 6 & 95 & 33 & 86 \\
 1 & 64 & 22 & 50 & 96 & 33 & 75 & 47 \\
 1 & 31 & 88 & 12 & 81 & 86 & 47 & 2 \\
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 32 & 41 & 79 & 38 & 34 & 89 & 74 & 2 \\
 41 & 29 & 45 & 70 & 42 & 46 & 25 & 90 \\
 79 & 45 & 2 & 66 & 43 & 95 & 14 & 44 \\
 38 & 70 & 66 & 2 & 44 & 89 & 60 & 19 \\
 34 & 42 & 43 & 44 & 47 & 25 & 22 & 34 \\
 89 & 46 & 95 & 89 & 25 & 81 & 76 & 81 \\
 74 & 25 & 14 & 60 & 22 & 76 & 15 & 5 \\
 2 & 90 & 44 & 19 & 34 & 81 & 5 & 16 \\
\end{array}
\right)^{-1}
$$
This is nice but once we invert the matrix, is not symmetric any more. Is there a matrix where both the original and its inverse are symmetric? The answer is yes! Consider the domain $\{1,33,22,47,96,64,75,50\}$:
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 33 & 22 & 47 & 96 & 64 & 75 & 50 \\
 1 & 22 & 96 & 75 & 1 & 22 & 96 & 75 \\
 1 & 47 & 75 & 33 & 96 & 50 & 22 & 64 \\
 1 & 96 & 1 & 96 & 1 & 96 & 1 & 96 \\
 1 & 64 & 22 & 50 & 96 & 33 & 75 & 47 \\
 1 & 75 & 96 & 22 & 1 & 75 & 96 & 22 \\
 1 & 50 & 75 & 64 & 96 & 47 & 22 & 33 \\
\end{array}
\right)

=

\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 85 & 85 & 85 & 85 & 85 & 85 & 85 & 85 \\
 85 & 79 & 70 & 8 & 12 & 18 & 27 & 89 \\
 85 & 70 & 12 & 27 & 85 & 70 & 12 & 27 \\
 85 & 8 & 27 & 79 & 12 & 89 & 70 & 18 \\
 85 & 12 & 85 & 12 & 85 & 12 & 85 & 12 \\
 85 & 18 & 70 & 89 & 12 & 79 & 27 & 8 \\
 85 & 27 & 12 & 70 & 85 & 27 & 12 & 70 \\
 85 & 89 & 27 & 18 & 12 & 8 & 70 & 79 \\
\end{array}
\right)^{-1}
$$
With this new domain and the same coefficients, we can find the evaluation points:
$$
\left(

Two questions:

1) How did we find the domain $\{1,33,22,47,96,64,75,50\}$?
2) If we use $\{1,33,22,47,96,64,75,50\}$, can we do the divide-and-conquer strategy? Is there a *combine* function that is workable and efficient for these "nice" matrices?

#### Generating symmetric matrices

$\{1,33,22,47,96,64,75,50\}$ is a special form. It is of the form $\{\omega^0,\omega^1,\omega^2,\omega^3,\omega^4,\omega^5,\omega^6,\omega^7\}$ where $\omega=33$. Why 33? The size of the domain is $8$, so we choose 33 because the multiplicative order of $\omega=33$ in $q=97$ is also $8$. Equivalently (in different jargon):

* 33 is a generator that generates a multiplicative subgroup of size 8 (mod 97)
* 33 is an 8-th root of unity of 97

So the trick is setting the $x$-values to be generators of a subgroup of the same size as the number of points/coefficients you have. Here we have 8, so we found a generator of order 8.

Can we find a generator of order 9 or 10 or 11 instead? The answer is no. Only certain sized subgroups exist. What dictates it? The answer is the value of $q$. Once $q$ is chosen, then the sizes of subgroups are locked in. Specifically the sizes available are the divisors of $q-1$. So if we factor $96$, we get $96=2^5\cdot3$. That means we have subgroups of size: $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96\}$. The value of $q$ for cryptography depends on the elliptic curve used. Something like $\texttt{bls12-381}$ uses a $q$ that purposefully has lots of subgroups: $\{2,4,8,\ldots,2^{32}\}$. 

The idea is that you find the degree of your polynomial $d$, then you need $d+1$ coefficients/points to represent it, and then you round $d+1$ up to the nearest power of 2 as necessary. The leading coefficients are set to 0. 

#### Revisiting divide-and-conquer

The remaining question is whether we can split the matrices into smaller (halve) matrices, and then combine the results. The answer is yes if the domain is based on roots of unity (for completeness, the answer is not necessarily no for other kinds of domains, but we do not explore that here). 

Recall, with the new domain, we have:
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 44 & 45 & 83 & 60 & 59 & 11 & 57 & 81 \\
\end{array}
\right)
\leftrightarrow
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 1 & 33 & 22 & 47 & 96 & 64 & 75 & 50 \\
 52 & 13 & 33 & 27 & 46 & 34 & 87 & 60 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
Instead of dividing the coefficients into the first half and second halves, we will divide them into even coefficients (coefficients of terms $x^i$ where $i$ is even, including 0) and odd coefficients. We treat these two sets of coefficients as new polynomials $P_\mathsf{even}(\square)$ and $P_\mathsf{odd}(\square)$. Then we combine the two based on the following property:
$$
P(\square)=P_{\mathsf{even}}(\square^2)+\square\cdot P_{\mathsf{odd}}(\square^2)
$$

How does this save computation? We compute the following values:
$$
P_\mathsf{even}(\boxed{\omega^0}^2)=P_\mathsf{even}(1)=57 \boxed{1}^3+59 \boxed{1}^2+83 \boxed{1}^1+44=49 \\

P_\mathsf{even}(\boxed{\omega^1}^2)=P_\mathsf{even}(22)=57 \boxed{22}^3+59 \boxed{22}^2+83 \boxed{22}^1+44=72 \\

P_\mathsf{even}(\boxed{\omega^2}^2)=P_\mathsf{even}(96)=57 \boxed{96}^3+59 \boxed{96}^2+83 \boxed{96}^1+44=60 \\

P_\mathsf{even}(\boxed{\omega^3}^2)=P_\mathsf{even}(75)=57 \boxed{75}^3+59 \boxed{75}^2+83 \boxed{75}^1+44=92 \\

\hline

P_\mathsf{odd}(\boxed{\omega^0}^2)=P_\mathsf{odd}(1)=81\boxed{1}^3+11\boxed{1}^2+60\boxed{1}^1+45=3 \\

P_\mathsf{odd}(\boxed{\omega^1}^2)=P_\mathsf{odd}{(22})= 81\boxed{22}^3+11\boxed{22}^2+60\boxed{22}^1+45=57 \\

P_\mathsf{odd}(\boxed{\omega^2}^2)=P_\mathsf{odd}(96)=81\boxed{96}^3+11\boxed{96}^2+60\boxed{96}^1+45=12 \\

P_\mathsf{odd}(\boxed{\omega^3}^2)=P_\mathsf{odd}(75)=81\boxed{75}^3+11\boxed{75}^2+60\boxed{75}^1+45=11 \\
$$
We are not done, we have to figure out what to do with these 8 values still. But before showing that, note that while we are performing 8 evaluations, the evaluations only have 4 coefficients, so this is half the work of not using divide-and-conquer. Further, through recursion, we will be halving this over and over again anyways. 

Also note that $P_\mathsf{even}(\boxed{\omega^0}^2)=P_\mathsf{even}(\boxed{\omega^4}^2)$ (or the multiplicative order of $\omega^2$ is half of $\omega$) which is why we only need to evaluate the first 4 values. 

To combine these values, we take the output of the even evaluations: $\{49, 72, 60, 92\}$ and repeat it: $E=\{49, 72, 60, 92,49, 72, 60, 92\}$. We do the same with odd: $O=\{3, 57, 12, 11,3, 57, 12, 11\}$. We then compute: $E+O\cdot\mathsf{domain}$ (where multiplication is element-wise):


$$
\{49, 72, 60, 92,49, 72, 60, 92\}+(\{3, 57, 12, 11,3, 57, 12, 11\}\cdot\{1,33,22,47,96,64,75,50\})\\
=\{52, 13, 33, 27, 46, 34, 87, 60\}
$$
That completes the operation and we have.
