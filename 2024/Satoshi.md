Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?
Stub of the article by Jeremy Clark (Concordia University)
Open to collaboration

The cryptocurrency Bitcoin was created by an individual, or collection of individuals, using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. In October 2018, Satoshi released a whitepaper describing the Bitcoin protocol. Later he released a software package for running the protocol, and spent around two years maintaining the software, communicating with users over email, and promoting the currency in online forums.

Many have been captivated by the question of who Satoshi really is, including the media. At least a dozen guesses, with varying degrees of journalistic evidence, have been made in print by reputable journalists working for the New York Times, Newsweek, The New Yorker, Wired, Forbes, Fast Company, and others. 

Despite the important consequences an answer to this question might hold, the topic of Satoshi’s identity is considered to be in the realm of speculation, gossip, and circumstantial evidence. We challenge this notion by attempting to say something scientific about the subject of Satoshi’s identity. It seems inevitable that the media will continue positing new Satoshi’s, while academics will throw their arms in the air and say, “probably not but who can really know?”

We believe that we owe the media and others a better response. In this article, we encourage interested parties to follow the framework of Baysian reasoning when thinking through the question of who Satoshi is, evaluating the likelihood of a particular candidate, and determining what kind of evidence is sufficient for such a claim. 
Bayes Primer
Bayes theorem is a mathematical relationship between probabilities that most people who have finished high school mathematics have seen but long forgotten. Think of it like a box sitting on a table.

“Kaminsky ticked off the skills Nakamoto would need to pull it off. “He’s a world-class programmer, with a deep understanding of the C++ programming language,” he said. “He understands economics, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. Either there’s a team of people who worked on this,” Kaminsky said, “or this guy is a genius.” Source

“The idiosyncratic construction of Bitcoin’s code also suggests that Satoshi had an academic background. It has been described as “brilliant but sloppy”, eschewing conventional software development practices like unit testing but exhibiting cutting-edge security architecture and an expert understanding of academic cryptography and economics.” Source

Techniques and critique
Antedote: critique with my bio, chaum, double space, canada // drunkard (linux)
Sytlometry: not understanding FP // rarest disease on earth // drunkard
Signing: only thing real
Personal interview: not reliable
IP and emails: reliable. CBC says 68.165.57.219 (I think this is wrong?) can points it to LA (Passionate Eye); also says IP of first transaction, that can’t be right. Other sources say 68.164.57.219
Location: Cali, Hal, Dorian -> correlation/causation -> third party
Bayes and Lewis thing: liar, lunatic, legend, lord -> Craig Wright
Cohesion in single person
Counterfuge: this we need to think about. Should be British, because bloody and times of london. BUT IF YOU WRE SATOSHI, wouldn’t you exactly want to do that to throw people off? Wouldn’t you want to converse with yourself (Hal)? Best way for Hal to hide being Satoshi is to go wholehog into Bitcoin (as oppose to never mention it ever?)
