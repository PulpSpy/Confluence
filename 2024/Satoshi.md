# Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

###### Early draft by Jeremy Clark (Concordia University)

###### Open to collaboration

------

The cryptocurrency Bitcoin was created by an individual, or collection of individuals, using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. In October 2018, Satoshi released a whitepaper describing the Bitcoin protocol. A few months later, he released a software package for running the protocol. He then spent around two years maintaining the software, communicating with developers, and promoting the project over email, mailing lists, online forums and IRC. After two years, Satoshi unceremoniously promoted Gavin Andresen to lead developer and left the project.

Against Satohsi's best wishes ("I wish you wouldn’t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle"), the media has been captivated by the question of who Satoshi really is. Many guesses, with varying degrees of journalistic evidence, have been made in print by reputable journalists working for the New York Times, Newsweek, The New Yorker, Wired, Forbes, Fast Company, and others. A few notable examples are provided in the Table above, along with primary basis (beyond basic demographics and technical expertise) for their conclusion. Each type of evidence will be expanded on later in this article.

### Why should we care?

| Who Cares?       | Example                                                      |

| Candidates       | D. Nakamoto was subjected to a "media frenzy" after being reported. |
| Friends & Family | Families of more than one candidate, in particular candidates who are no longer living, report unwelcome inquiries from Bitcoin enthusiasts. |
| Investors        | A business deal between nCrypt and C. Wright was reported to be contingent on Wright being able to prove claim of being Satoshi. |
| Retail Investors | Some users report investing savings in blockchain technologies associated with Satoshi candidates. |
| Experts          | Experts (e.g., G. Andresen & N. Courtois) have been retained to assess a candidate's claim to being Satoshi; or (e.g.,  S. Meiklejohn) to serve as an expert witness.. |
| Courts           | Various actions, most notably *COPA v. C. S. Wright*, give legal consideration to ownership of Bitcoin's technology vis-a-vis whether a candidate is Satoshi (on balance of probabilities). |
| Journalists      | L. McGrath Goodman reports threats of violence in retaliation for her article identify a Satoshi candidate. |

Generally, academics have maintained an aversion to the subject of Satoshi's identity, chalking up endeavours to uncover it as gossip, speculation, and not in the realm of science. Our position is that the subject of Satoshi matters to enough people (see table above) that academics should not remain quiet. We do not affirm new attempts to de-anonymize Satoshi. Rather we believe those with relevant expertise can help establish rules of evidence and ensure that weak evidence is not left unquestioned.

## A Preview of the Evidence

Journalists (and others) seeking to identify Satoshi Nakamoto will argue about their candidate using a set of evidence (or "fact pattern)". But the evidence need to be part of a larger framework to establish if the facts are meaningful, sufficient, and complete. There is also the possibility of bias. Our goal is to outline (1) possible frameworks, (2) possible biases, and (3) possible evidence. A takeaway is that investigators should be more rigours in terms of (1), and guard better against (2), as most of the evidence (3) is not conclusive enough to be relied on alone.

It is also important to distinguish between "doxing" and "vetting" investigations. In a doxing investigation, the investigator is finding and proposing a candidate that does not want to be identified as Satoshi. This candidate will not provide new evidence that could help prove they are Satoshi, but might offer new evidence to suggest they are not. In a vetting investigation, the candidate is claiming to be Satoshi and therefore is positioned to back up their claim with new evidence. A takeaway from our paper is that there is not enough known about Satoshi to sufficiently dox him without new collaborating evidence. However there are types of evidence that can be created by Satoshi that would be close to sufficient in vetting his identity.

Later in the article, we will walk through each piece of evidence one-by-one. At this time, we want to first discuss frameworks and biases. However by previewing the evidence first, we can illustrate the frameworks and biases with concrete examples pulled from the evidence. 

## Frameworks

| Possible Frameworks | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| MMO                 | Determining the motive, means, and opportunity for creating Bitcoin |
| Profiling           | Matching a candidate to the predicted psychology of Satoshi  |
| Bayesian inference  | A rule of probability for evaluating evidence                |
| Guess who           | A board game that provides a simpler mental model than Bayesian inference |
| Occam's razor       | Preferring simple explanations to complex ones               |

Several possible frameworks are listed in the table above. Each is used at least once by a journalist or other investigator. They are not a complete set of frameworks, nor are they a mutually exclusive set of frameworks----an investigator could use any combination of them in addition to other possible methods. However understanding this set of frameworks will help illuminate the momentous nature of the task of identifying Satoshi. 

### MMO Framework

An investigator could take an approach used, to some extent, by law enforcement (and to a large extent by law enforcement on TV): establishing the *motive*, *means*, and *opportunity*. 

Satoshi's *motive* for creating Bitcoin is to try an approach not used in other centralized cryptography projects. As noted by Ducrée [Duc22], Satoshi is relatively apolitical. While many early Bitcoin adopters exhibited a fondness for libertarianism and/or a cypherpunk philosophy, Satoshi does not strongly align himself with either. He once marked Bitcoin as "a new territory of freedom," but also lamented those who are so "anti-fiat-money that anything short of gold isn't good enough." Satoshi vocalizes support for the EFF, Tor, and P2P file sharing. The genesis block of Bitcoin includes the quote: "chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks," which is taken as a criticism of bailouts. Such a position aligns with both populism and libertarianism---bailouts were pursued by both the chancellor's left-leaning Labour Party in the UK and the right-leaning Republican Party in the US over the same time-period. Aside from mildly political statements like these, Satoshi sticks to technical discussions. 

*Motive* can also go to anonymity. In a foreword to a popular Bitcoin textbook, Clark [Cla16] considers reasons why Satoshi would choose anonymity at a time when BTC was not even deployed and had no value. Pragmatic reasons could be avoiding legal issues (operators of e-gold pled guilty to financial crimes a few months before Bitcoin's whitepaper) or patent issues (mailing list participants were known to fret about both [Surety patents](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gzz-dev/2003-07/msg00043.html) and [DigiCash patents](http://marc.info/?l=cypherpunks&m=95280154628360&w=2)), while philosophical reasons could include alignment with the cypherpunk movement. For candidates with projects and research papers that are not released anonymously, inconsistency requires justification.

*Means* captures the ability to design and deploy Bitcoin, which requires technical skills like C++ app development, knowledge of cryptography, and the ability to use anonymity technology. As these skills are taken as evidence ("basic expertise" in the Table above), we will discuss these specifically later in the article.

*Opportunity* creates limits on the *time* and *place* of candidates. For Bitcoin, time is an important consideration, while location is largely open as Satoshi interacted solely online with efforts at making tracing infeasible. The circumstantial evidence (in the Table above) does include some location-based facts which we will examine later. Time and place can also eliminate candidates (i.e., provide an alibi). For example, the McGrath-Goodman investigation ruled out Nick Szabo for having an incompatible timeline before centring on Dorian Nakamoto [tkcite]. Another candidate, Hal Finny, ran in an organized marathon with registration and finish-line photographs at the same time Satoshi Nakamoto was sending emails [tkcite].

### Profiling

On a recent podcast, L. McGrath Goodman defends the methodology used by her and Newsweek in identifying Dorian Nakamoto [tkcite]. The main basis she relied on is "profiling" which, like the MMO framework, was developed by law enforcement (pioneered by FBI agent John E. Douglas and popularized by TV shows Mindhunters and Criminal Minds). Investigators develop a psychological profile of the candidate that fits the evidence. For McGrath Goodman, this meant interviewing major Bitcoin developers (she notes it was early enough in Bitcoin history that they were easy to contact and willing to talk) and deducing Satoshi was someone secretive, reclusive, able to maintain confidentiality, and intelligent. When she found Dorian Nakamoto, she felt he matched the profile (his work was classified and his family stated he was secretive about his work). Ducrée [Duc22] also builds a psychological profile of Satoshi, which overlaps with McGrath Goodman, rooted in ingenuity, persistence, motivated by ideals, and confidentiality [tkcite]. Even if a profile is right, it is of limited use if it is not specific. Dorian Nakamoto is not the only person in the world to fit the profile. In both cases, these profiles are taken in combination with other forms of evidence (tables above).

In the case of a candidate that claims to be Satoshi, profiling can be used in two ways. As above, the Satoshi profile can be used to vet the candidate. However, since most people who are not Satoshi do not claim to be Satoshi (even if they happen match the profile or the evidence), candidates should also be vetted against a profile of anti-social behaviour and deception. E.G. Sirer writes in a blog post, "There’s a big difference between a case that has weak evidence and a case where the evidence contains forged elements. The latter requires a full explanation of the forger, their relationship to the story, and should put the entire story at risk. You can’t just look past that inexplicable problem and focus on the rest. The story changes the moment a piece of the evidence is forged. [tkcite]"

### Bayes Theorem

The most precise tool for evaluating evidence is Bayes theorem, however its usefulness is limited by its requirement for having probabilities for many of the things around us. Bayesian inference (which is basically the application of Bayes theorem over and over with a sequence of evidence) lets us reason about how the probability that a candidate is Satoshi, Pr["Alice is Satoshi"], changes as new evidence is evaluated. Consider an example: we know an IP address that seems to be Satoshi's from Los Angeles. Assume Alice was living in Sherman Oaks on 10 Jan 2009. Does this fact increase or decrease the probability that Alice is Satoshi Nakamoto? And by how much? What if, additionally, Alice is a cryptographer?

The process needs a starting probability, called the *prior* or *baseline*, which is the probability that Alice is Satoshi given you know nothing else about her. We could take the prior to be 1 in 7 billion assuming Alice and Satoshi are both humans alive in 2008. 

The output of the first evaluation of evidence is an updated probability that "Alice is Satoshi" *given* that "Alice lived in Sherman Oaks." Mathematically: Pr["Alice is Satoshi" | "Alice lived in Sherman Oaks"] is called the *posterior*. To figure out if posterior will increase or decrease, by a little or by a lot, we need two more probabilities. The first is the probability that Alice, as a random human alive in 2008, happens to live there: Pr["Alice lived in Sherman Oaks"]; called the *marginal probability*. Imagine a world where everyone in the world lives in Sherman Oaks, then the fact that both Alice and Satoshi have a tie to the region does not help Alice's prospects of being Satoshi much. Conversely, in a world where almost no one lives there, this could be a significant piece of evidence. How many people lived in Sherman Oaks in 2018? Around 50,000. So Pr["Alice lived in Sherman Oaks"]=50,000/7,000,000,000=0.0007%.

So far this has nothing to do with Satoshi, which is why we need the second value called the *likelihood* which is critical to think about whether or not you are formally applying Bayesian inference. It says: assume that Alice is actually Satoshi. What is the probability that Alice will live in Sherman Oaks, given she is Satoshi. In other words, how much more likely is it that Satoshi lives in Sherman Oaks than a random person does (which is 0.0007%). If he is more likely to live there than the average person, this helps Alice's prospects of being Satoshi. If he is less likely than the average person, it hurts her prospects. The degree to which it helps or hurts is the ratio between them: Pr["Alice lived in Sherman Oaks" | "Alice is Satoshi"]/Pr["Alice lived in Sherman Oaks"]. This ratio acts as a scalar that boosts (when the ratio is greater than 1) or diminishes (when the ratio is less than 1) the *prior* probability.

So what is the number? If Satoshi is as likely to live anywhere in the world, it is 0.0007%. But we know Satoshi operated in timezone that fits California's timezone better than, say, Japan. We also have a link between Satoshi and an IP address from the greater LA area (detailed later in the article), which includes Sherman Oaks. This IP address might not be Satoshi's, it could be a proxy for Satoshi, it could also be that he was travelling there and does not live there. And it could have been from an area near, but not exactly, Sherman Oaks. 

Some of these factors are hard to quantify. However, remarkably, Bayesian inference works well with estimates (e.g., super-forecasting, author of Death Note script, criminal allegations against Judge Kavanaugh). If rough numbers go into the model, you will of course get a rough outputs, but approximate probabilities can still be useful: the difference between an output of .01% or 60% can help build intuition for how far evidence can take you. 

To help incorporate the timing of Satoshi's activities, assume the following:

* 4%: random timezone is UTC-8 (1/24).
* 8%: Satoshi's timezone is UTC-8 based on timestamp evidence, as follows: assume UTC-5 is Satoshi's most likely timezone for Jan 2009 and assume moving over a timezone (in either direction) follows a bell curve (binomial distribution with p=0.5).

* 0.0014%: Updated probability Satoshi lives in Sherman Oaks (compared to prior of 0.0007%).

To help incorporate that Satoshi accidentally disclosed his IP address which was assigned by an ISP in the greater LA region, assume the following:

* 10%: Sherman Oaks residents that use an internet device with this ISP.
* 20,000: non-residents of Sherman Oaks that also use this ISP (could reside elsewhere in LA or could be tourists).
* 20%: Resulting probability that the holder of this IP address lives in Sherman Oaks.
* 75%: Probability that Satoshi is the holder of this IP address.
* 5.4%: Updated probability that Satoshi lived in Sherman Oaks (compared to prior of 0.0014%).

Putting this together, what is the probability that Alice is Satoshi given that Alice lives in Sherman Oaks? The prior is 1 in 7 billion (Alice is Satoshi based on nothing?), the marginal probability is 0.0007% (Alice lives in Sherman Oaks based on nothing?), and the likelihood is 5.4% (Alice lives in Sherman Oaks if she is Satoshi?). The result is 0.0001% or 1 in 10,000.

Now assume Alice knows has a moderate level of knowledge in cryptography. We can ask how this improves her chances of being Satoshi by assuming the following:

* 1,000,000: number of people in the world who understand hash functions and digital signatures. This number is hard to estimate. There are 100,000 CISSP certified professionals who write an exam covering cryptography. There are 10,000 computer scientist graduates *a year* globally, many who take at least one crypto course. There are also many kinds of IT people without a CS degree or a CISSP certification that understand cryptography.

* 100%: assume Alice is actually Satoshi, what is the probability she understands cryptography?

Applying Bayes theorem, the previous prior is 1 in 10,000 (Alice is Satoshi based on evidence so far), the marginal probability is 1 in 1,000,000 (Alice is a cryptographer based on nothing?), and the likelihood is 100% (Alice is a cryptographer if she is Satoshi?). The result is 0.75% or 1 in 133. 

The next best evidence is C++ but the overlap between crypto expertise and C++ expertise is likely to be substantial (we ignore the overlap between crypto knowledge and living in Sherman Oaks).

### Guess Who

* Bayesian inference is powerful and can be used informally to reason about candidates without numbers, but we can consider a simplification of it. Consider the board game "Guess Who" (if unfamiliar, see short explanation on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F)). Imagine playing the game with 6 billion faces instead of 24 faces. If you used a sequence of questions, each eliminating half of the remaining candidates, how many questions would you have to ask to find Satoshi? 33 questions. If each question eliminated 90% of the candidates, 10 questions would be sufficient.

* With Guess Who, faces start up and are flipped down; there is no in-between. A Bayesian version of Guess Who would allow faces to be in-between "flipped up" and "flipped down." In this case, with a low prior, faces would start mostly flipped down and it would take work to flip them up. 

* One blog post [ZG21] purports a mathematical proof that C. Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, providing both a method and an application of the method. The article is informal and our assessment is that it is ultimately fallacious, but the author did participate as an expert witness in one court case concerning who Satoshi is. After a false start of explaining, but failing to use, Bayes theorem (an appropriate method we address below), it instead uses an approach that we will describe as the "Guess Who" method.

### Occam's Razor

* Clark [Cla16] argues Satoshi is most likely a single individual (Occam's razor is discussed below) as years of communication was self-consistent and displayed deep knowledge of all aspects of Bitcoin. 

* > "**#2 It Would Require An Exceptionally Elaborate False Trail** There are volumes of forum and email messages between Satoshi and Andresen. If these were faked, Satoshi must have spent more time writing fake emails to convince the world he wasn’t Gavin Andresen than he did writing code for Bitcoin."

##  Biases

| Biases                   | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Streetlight effect       | Candidates are picked from known individuals                 |
| Cherry-picking           | Only circumstantial evidence that matches is presented       |
| Salience bias            | Highlighting that a candidate might say "bloody" and "maths" over an inability to program in C++ |
| Unfalsifiable subterfuge | If circumstantial evidence does not match, it ruled out as being subterfuge |
| Base rate neglect        | The probability that anyone is Satoshi starts from a low prior |
|                          |                                                              |

Investigations in Satoshi's identity can be subverted by subtle biases the investigator might not realize they are making. A preview of them are in the Table above, and below we detail each one. This is not meant to be a complete set of biases, however these are the five that we were able to notice when we critically examined existing Satoshi investigations. 

### Streetlight effect

Consider the following parable, as quoted (via Wikipedia) from [tkcite]:

> A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where the light is."

When looking for a Satoshi candidate, it is impossible to consider every human on earth. Therefore investigations might need to start with a shortlist of candidates. Examples include: "people named Satoshi Nakamoto" [Newsweek], "people who wrote about digital cash before Bitcoin" [New York Times], "people who used a particular phrase like 'computationally impractical to reverse' in text that is searchable online" [Fast Company], or "people who attended CRYPTO 2011" [The New Yorker]. Does the real Satoshi fit any or all of these criteria? Bayesian analysis would command us to think about the world of people left outside of this criteria and suggest that is more probably where Satoshi is.

### Cherry-picking and salience

Many Satoshi arguments are anecdotes about the candidate such as the following:

> *When Satoshi created Bitcoin, Alice was a graduate student in cryptography at the University of Waterloo (coincidentally when Vitalik Buterin, a creator of Ethereum, was there as an undergrad). The university is the main hub for elliptic curve cryptography. Alice was taught in high school to double-space after periods and being Canadian, uses spellings and colloquialisms of the British commonwealth. In Alice's research, she worked with David Chaum, the cryptography pioneer who invented digital cash and lived in Sherman Oaks, California (Alice's whereabouts in Jan 2009 are unaccounted for). When Satoshi took a long break from active development on Bitcoin, Alice was preparing to run the world's first cryptographically secure election in Nov 2009 using a system called Scantegrity with Chaum (later in 2011, Scantegrity would record election data in Bitcoin's blockchain). Satoshi became more active in mid-Nov 2009. Alice's other research subjects included time-stamping through stock data found in a newspaper, financial topics, and her masters thesis topic was on Tor, the anonymity software used by Satoshi to hide his IP address. Alice's research was discussed widely, including on the cryptography mailing list in Dec 2007.*

While the name has been changed, this in fact describes a real person (an author of this article). The description sounds convincing and casual readers of newspaper might think Satoshi has finally been found. They would be wrong: Alice is not proficient in C++, only coding in Mathematica or Java. Despite being taught otherwise, she does not actually double space after periods. While Alice grew up in "grey" county, Alice does not (nor do Canadians generally) say "bloody" or "maths." And the list of missed evidence goes on. Generally anecdotes like this tend to emphasize matching details (the *cherries* being picked) and fail to comment on the details that do not match.

Additionally, some evidence (such as cryptography or C++ proficiency) are strong requirements, while other evidence (such as a tie to Japan due to the name Satoshi Nakamoto) is less important, with alternative explanations that are easy to make. Consider the case where a witness testified to walking in on a Satoshi candidate working on his computer dressed like a ninja. The same candidate had earlier failed, under oath, to explain what a uint is in C++. If the first detail is more memorable, memorable, interesting, and vivid (i.e., *salient*), while the second is more important to the case, it would be biased to emphasize the first. 

### Unfalsifiable subterfuge

* Imagine Alice's license place is observed on a car seen peeling away from a bank robbery. Bob says, "Well, that proves that Alice *didn't* rob the bank." Bob responds to your puzzled look, "Alice would not be so stupid to use her own car. If you saw her license plate, that means she didn't do it!" 
* Subterfuge: this we need to think about. Should be British, because bloody and times of london. BUT IF YOU WRE SATOSHI, wouldn’t you exactly want to do that to throw people off? Wouldn’t you want to converse with yourself (Hal)? Best way for Hal to hide being Satoshi is to go wholehog into Bitcoin (as oppose to never mention it ever?)
* "If I had forged that document, then it would be perfect." Craig Wright

### Base-rate neglect

Imagine a medical test that determines if someone has a really rare disease. Say it is so rare that only one person on earth has it. Say the medical test in 99.99% accurate and we somehow manage to test everyone on earth with it. Everyone who tests positive is put in a room. That room will include the person who has it but it will also include many people with a false test result. How many? In fact, the will not fit in a room. It will be 700,000, similar in number to all the people living in Oklahoma City. Put a different way, let's say Alice tests positive. What is the probability she actually has the disease? It is infinitesimal at well under one-thousandth of one percent. This is counter-intuitive as Kahneman and Tversky demonstrated by creating similar scenarios for experts (like doctors) to study—they routinely thought positive tests were a strong (but not perfect) indication of having the disease (this was part of a research program that was awarded a Noble prize in 2002).

Recall the *prior* or *base-rate* is one portion of Bayesian inference. If this number is small (such 1 in 7 billion for Satoshi), the evidence must be very persuasive to move it toward 100%. The types of things known about Satoshi are somewhat specific (C++ proficiency, cryptography expertise, word choice, suspected locations) but they are like the 99.99% accurate test: they fail to pick Satoshi out of a haystack that includes the global population.



## Evidence Analysis





### Basic demographics

Age



### Basic expertise

> "In general, professors typically have a fairly narrow expertise, and uncovering secret identities is not one of them... But all professors have one particular skill: to be able to size up someone’s technical understanding and characterize where he or she has technical misconceptions." EGS

* “Kaminsky ticked off the skills Nakamoto would need to pull it off. “He’s a world-class programmer, with a deep understanding of the C++ programming language,” he said. “He understands economics, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. Either there’s a team of people who worked on this,” Kaminsky said, “or this guy is a genius.” Source

* “The idiosyncratic construction of Bitcoin’s code also suggests that Satoshi had an academic background. It has been described as “brilliant but sloppy”, eschewing conventional software development practices like unit testing but exhibiting cutting-edge security architecture and an expert understanding of academic cryptography and economics.” Source

* C++ developer experience  Described as "brilliant but sloppy"
* Crypto: "But EC-DSA can't encrypt messages like RSA, it can only be used to verify signatures." SN

### Anecdotal evidence

* Andresen recently walked back his position: “I now know it was a mistake to trust Craig Wright as much as I did. I regret getting sucked into the ‘who is (or isn’t) Satoshi’ game,” he wrote in February 2023 in a [revision](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi) to an earlier blog post.

* Sytlometry: not understanding FP // rarest disease on earth // drunkard



> I can't help but wonder if Linux was released under a pseudonym, would anyone guess that it was written by a Finnish masters student? Someone that was otherwise unknown? Of course not. Someone would compare the writing to Richard Stallman, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and some super random patent holders, and declare Stallman the winner. Then Newsweek would find him at the end of his driveway, annoyed and in a crumpled t-shirt, chewing on something he pulled off his foot. :)



### Circumstantial evidence

#### Double-space

* A typing pattern, somewhat common at the time—used by 17 of 28 (61%) participants on the cryptography mailing list in Nov 2008 including Satoshi

#### Colloquialisms

* Word choices and spellings include: bloody, colour, defence, eat crow, grey, maths, neighbours, sweet


#### Activities

* Less active between midnight and 6am ET, whitepaper generated with MT setting

#### IP address

* IP address 68.164.57.219 (from 10 Jan 2009) traces to Van Nuyes, CA, USA
* Location: Cali, Hal, Dorian -> correlation/causation -> third party

#### UK proximity

* Quote in Bitcoin (from 03 Jan 2009) taken from a newspaper based in London, UK—likely the domestic and physical edition

#### Japanese culture

* Used the name Satoshi Nakamoto
* made no translations himself but worked on getting some

#### Mailing list

* Was familiar with and first advertised on the cryptography mailing list and later on other online forums

#### Birthdate

* P2P Foundation account registered with birthdate of 5 April 1975
* LMG on Dorian: younger than he seemed

#### Software

* Used Microsoft Windows and OpenOffice

#### Occupation

* Describes himself as "not a lawyer," "busy with work," and declares it is "good to be coding again" after a break from Bitcoin development.

#### Academic pedigree

* Aware of linked timestamping and hashcash; unaware initially of b-money, bit gold, and reusable proof of work (RPOW).

* Most citations are relevant or provenance (conversations about citing specific papers)

  Citation [2] is a curious case:

  * A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post [2-5].
  * To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7] [2] [5]

* The first instance of the citation is not that interesting, it is included in a blanket of 4 papers about time-stamping without anything specific about the paper. The second instance is interesting as Satoshi deliberately excludes [3] and [4] from the idea of using a Merkle Tree [7], while noting that Haber & Stornetta's earlier works [2] and [5] do not. This convinces me that Satoshi knows more than the title of [2] and knows some details of it. Unlike modern academic papers, a copy of [2] is not available online and is only available in print. Further, it is a regional conference (Netherlands and Belgium) and its proceedings are not widely disseminated. It also was not a well-cited paper (before Bitcoin popularized it) and was one of several papers put out by researchers affiliated with the TIMESEC project from KU/UC Leuven.

* So probably either: (i) Satoshi obtained a paper copy of it and read it; or (ii) he read an uncited paper that in turn cited [2] and he copied the citation. In case (i), it is also interesting that An overview of the conference (1980--2023) is available and includes small (~1 page) summaries of electronic payments, followed by time-stamping. The latter cites [2] but nothing else in it seems tied to Satoshi's writings.
