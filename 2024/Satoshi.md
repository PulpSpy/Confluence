# Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

###### Early draft by Jeremy Clark (Concordia University)

###### Open to collaboration



The cryptocurrency Bitcoin was created by an individual, or collection of individuals, using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. In October 2018, Satoshi released a whitepaper describing the Bitcoin protocol. A few months later, he released a software package for running the protocol. He then spent around two years maintaining the software, communicating with users over email, and promoting the currency in online forums. After two years, Satoshi unceremoniously promoted Gavin Andresen to lead developer and left the project. 

Many have been captivated by the question of who Satoshi really is, including the media. At least a dozen guesses, with varying degrees of journalistic evidence, have been made in print by reputable journalists working for the New York Times, Newsweek, The New Yorker, Wired, Forbes, Fast Company, and others. A few notable examples are provided in the Table below.

It seems inevitable that the media will continue positing new Satoshi’s and readers will keep reading them. Academics will throw their arms in the air and say, “probably not but who can really know?” Bitcoin enthusiasts will follow Gavin Andresen in believing "Satoshi's identity doesn't matter"



Many in the Bitcoin community 

Despite the important consequences an answer to this question might hold, the topic of Satoshi’s identity is considered to be in the realm of speculation, gossip, and circumstantial evidence. We challenge this notion by attempting to say something scientific about the subject of Satoshi’s identity.

## Circumstantial evidence



Anecdotes

Many Satoshi arguments are anecdotes about the candidate with cherry-picked circumstantial evidence. An example might read like the following.

When Satoshi created Bitcoin, Alice was a graduate student in cryptography and computer science at the University of Waterloo (overlapping with undergradate Vitalik Buterin, a creator of Ethereum). A high school student up in the 1990s, Alice was taught to double-space after periods; Canadians, part of the British commonwealth, use British spellings and colloquialisms; and as a grad student, Alice maintained an unruly schedule, working late into the night and maintaining a timezone closer to California than Eastern. Alice's research was in cryptography, where she worked with David Chaum, the cryptography pioneer who invented digital cash (working throughout his career with people like Nick Szabo, zooko, Len Sassasan). Her whereabouts are unaccounted for   is uncertain if Alice visited Chaum in 20XX, who lived near Van Nuys Blvd in Sherman Oakes, California (IP address). At the time Satoshi wrote he was "moving on to other projects," Alice was preparing... Put results on Bitcoin and wrote 3rd paper on it. Beacons and times of london. Tor Other research subjects including random beacons (using quotes from newspapers to timestamp) and the Tor anonymity network. Lurked and occasionally posted on cryptography mailing list. Later Alice is photographed at the infamous Princeton roundtable. Windows Vista. Libertarian. 

Sounds pretty good right? Well, consider the following:

Bitcoin was written in C++ while Alice's projects were written in Java. Alice did not directly program the application but focused on protocols and prototyping in high level languages like Mathematica. Despite learning to type with two spaces after a period, zero of Alice's prolific online writing demonstrates this hallmark. 



“Kaminsky ticked off the skills Nakamoto would need to pull it off. “He’s a world-class programmer, with a deep understanding of the C++ programming language,” he said. “He understands economics, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. Either there’s a team of people who worked on this,” Kaminsky said, “or this guy is a genius.” Source

“The idiosyncratic construction of Bitcoin’s code also suggests that Satoshi had an academic background. It has been described as “brilliant but sloppy”, eschewing conventional software development practices like unit testing but exhibiting cutting-edge security architecture and an expert understanding of academic cryptography and economics.” Source

"**#2 It Would Require An Exceptionally Elaborate False Trail** There are volumes of forum and email messages between Satoshi and Andresen. If these were faked, Satoshi must have spent more time writing fake emails to convince the world he wasn’t Gavin Andresen than he did writing code for Bitcoin."

Establishing a prior probability
Base rate fallacy
Drunkard and lost keys
Example: Linus Torvalds - Finnish grad student, must have been a team, guess other high profile OS people: Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie (disregards why they would rival their own) or most colourful: Richard Stallman



Subterfuge: this we need to think about. Should be British, because bloody and times of london. BUT IF YOU WRE SATOSHI, wouldn’t you exactly want to do that to throw people off? Wouldn’t you want to converse with yourself (Hal)? Best way for Hal to hide being Satoshi is to go wholehog into Bitcoin (as oppose to never mention it ever?)

Bayes theorem is a mathematical relationship between probabilities that most people who have finished high school mathematics have seen but long forgotten. Think of it like a box sitting on a table.

Given a theory t and pieces of evidence e1, e2, and e3, what is new probably of t being correct?



Pr[ t | e ] = ell * Pr[t]



Pr[t] is called the prior or baseline probability. It is the probability that t is true before you consider the evidence. It is a common fallacy to not appreciate the significance the prior has on the result. Given a very low prior (e.g., super rare disease), even with strong evidence (a positive result from an accurate test), the probability of t (that you have the disease) might stay small.



Pr[t|e] is called the posterior probability. It is the “updated” value of Pr[t] after considering the evidence.



ell is a scaling function that will increase, decrease, or not impact Pr[t] depending on how supportive the evidence is for t. 



ell is not a probability itself. If ell=0, then the probability goes to zero and t and e are mutually exclusive. If ell is between 0 and 1, the probability of t decreases (thus e does not support t). If ell is exactly 1, then t and e are independent. If ell is between 1 and a max value we’ll call max for now, then the probability of t increases (thus e supports t). If ell is max, then the probability goes to 1 (certainty) and e proves t. 



What is max? Well, it is a bit ugly because Pr[t|e] is a probability and thus can only go to one. So it is going to be some ratio between Pr[t|e] and Pr[t]. Specifically it is 1/Pr[t]. 



== Liklihood



So how do we compute ell? It requires us to know something about the evidence e, its probability and how it is linked to t. There are a few formulations of ell (obviously equivalent) that depend on what you want to estimate to compute it.



Variant 1: ell( Pr[e|t], Pr[e]) = Pr[e|t]/Pr[e]

Variant 2: ell( Pr[e|t], Pr[e|!t] ) = Pr[e|t]/(Pr[e|t]*Pr[t] + Pr[e|!t]*Pr[!t])



Pr[e] - the probability of seeing the evidence (marginal probability)

Pr[e|t] - assuming the theory is true, what is the probability this evidence will come to light (likelihood)

Pr[e|!t] - assuming the theory is not true, what is the probability this evidence will come to light



In terms of a filter, Pr[e|!t] is the probability of a false positive and 1-Pr[e|!t] is the true negatives. Pr[e|t] is the true positives and 1-Pr[e|t] is the probability of a false negative. 



Example: probability email is spam because spam filter labels it spam. Key influences (variant 2):

1. the probability of spam in the first place: if spam is super rare, the probability this is spam is low
2. the probability of spam being labeled spam (accuracy or true positive)
3. the probability of non-spam being mislabeled as spam (false positive)



Note: It is tempting to think Pr[e|t] + Pr[e|!t] = Pr[e]. This is not the case:

Pr[e|t]*Pr[t] + Pr[e|!t]*Pr[!t] = Pr[e]



Example: probability the coin will flip heads given it is raining. Say the probability it is raining is 30%. Then the probability it is raining given the coin flips heads is the same as if it flips tails. So Pr[e|t] = Pr[e|!t]. We can consider these two values as a ratio (odds or likelihood ratio): o=Pr[e|t]/Pr[e|!t]. If o=1, e and t are independent. If o>1, then it e supports t. If o<1, then it does not support t. 








## Anecdotal evidence



Andresen recently walked back his position: “I now know it was a mistake to trust Craig Wright as much as I did. I regret getting sucked into the ‘who is (or isn’t) Satoshi’ game,” he wrote in February 2023 in a [revision](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi) to an earlier blog post.

## Academic Pedigree

Most citations are relevant or provenance (conversations about citing specific papers)

Citation [2] is a curious case:

* A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post [2-5].
* To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7] [2] [5]
* References
* [1] W. Dai, "b-money," http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt, 1998.

  trust requirements," In 20th Symposium on Information Theory in the Benelux, May 1999.

The first instance of the citation is not that interesting, it is included in a blanket of 4 papers about time-stamping without anything specific about the paper. The second instance is interesting as Satoshi deliberately excludes [3] and [4] from the idea of using a Merkle Tree [7], while noting that Haber & Stornetta's earlier works [2] and [5] do not. This convinces me that Satoshi knows more than the title of [2] and knows some details of it. Unlike modern academic papers, a copy of [2] is not available online and is only available in print. Further, it is a regional conference (Netherlands and Belgium) and its proceedings are not widely disseminated. It also was not a well-cited paper (before Bitcoin popularized it) and was one of several papers put out by researchers affiliated with the TIMESEC project from KU/UC Leuven.

 So probably either: (i) Satoshi obtained a paper copy of it and read it; or (ii) he read an uncited paper that in turn cited [2] and he copied the citation. In case (i), it is also interesting that An overview of the conference (1980--2023) is available and includes small (~1 page) summaries of electronic payments, followed by time-stamping. The latter cites [2] but nothing else in it seems tied to Satoshi's writings.

Quote from artice: 

[What we know and can prove](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/b318ih/in_honor_of_craig_wrights_ragequit_from_twitter_i/eiwho2w/) is that:

- He has a documented history of questionable statements and activities.
- He has a history of appearing to exaggerate his academic credentials.
- He has made a multitude of technical errors in his writings that call his understanding of Bitcoin and internet technology into question.
- His [writing style](https://www.ibtimes.com/craig-wright-not-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-according-new-text-analysis-2276141) (according to text analysis) and demeanor do not appear to be the same as those of the Satoshi whose writings are [archived here](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/).
- [Wright once said](https://web.archive.org/web/20190307144326/https:/twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/1102886416206520322): “I am a lawyer and this [financial law] is my area of speciality,” whereas the [real Satoshi](https://web.archive.org/web/20190319211741/https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread2.html), when asked about how a financial law applied to Bitcoin, said, “I am not a lawyer and I can’t possibly answer that.”
- [Wright once said](https://archive.fo/qljA9#selection-349.52-349.108): “At no point have I said that Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency,” and yet [Satoshi called Bitcoin a cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/b479rk/please_excuse_the_craig_wright_spam_but_this_is/) on several occasions.
- [Wright once said](https://www.ccn.com/craig-wright-rants-about-why-satoshi-fcking-abandoned-bitcoin/) that he is an “academic coder” who has no idea about “real world coding” but [Satoshi has said](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/12/#selection-89.82-89.126), “I’m better with code than with words though.”
- In 2008, just six months before the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto appeared, Wright [made a public post](https://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/42) stating, “Anonymity is the shield of cowards, it is the cover used to defend their lies. My life is open and I have little care for my privacy.”
- In February 2011, he seemed unaware of Bitcoin at all, as he was thinking about [starting a gold-backed payment system](https://archive.is/3UwA7).
- In August 2011, he began to mention Bitcoin in his writings, but he [called it “Bit Coin](https://theconversation.com/lulzsec-anonymous-freedom-fighters-or-the-new-face-of-evil-2605#comment_6162), whereas Satoshi [didn’t use a space or capital *C*](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/) in emails or forum posts. There was [one instance of “BitCoin”](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e071a3f6c06f41068ad17134189a4ac3073ef76b/readme.txt#L1) in the early codebase, but Satoshi himself [later corrected the capitalization](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/28/).
- He [actively bought and traded coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hx3q9/according_to_the_mtgox_leaks_from_early_2014_our/) on Mt. Gox [in 2013 and 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hqbux/fun_fact_craig_wright_lost_14_in_mtgox/).
- He [once asked](https://archive.fo/TEykO) why you would use *X*s rather than zeros in a burn address. Satoshi Nakamoto invented the [Base58 encoding scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58) used for these addresses, which intentionally excludes numbers and letters that look similar, such as zero and the letter *O*.
- He [once claimed](https://archive.fo/FYsWT) that Bitcoin’s block size was set in the block header (it’s not).
- He [once claimed](https://web.archive.org/web/20171029130922/https:/twitter.com/proffaustus/status/924242722810195968) that Satoshi chose the secp256k1 curve due to bi-linear pairing properties but [Satoshi once said](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread3.html) that “I didn't find anything to recommend a curve type so I just ... picked one.”
- In [an interview with GQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YUTq7_vO3A&feature=youtu.be&t=304), Wright claimed, "I haven’t moved [any bitcoins]. I have sent them to Hal Finney and Zooko and that was it. Full stop." But in 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto [sent 82.51 BTC to developer Mike Hearn](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html).
- He has thus far failed to provide simple cryptographic proof that he controls keys belonging to Satoshi [**after promising to do so**.](https://gizmodo.com/craig-wright-claims-he-will-move-satoshi-nakamotos-bitc-1774443766)
- The cryptographic “proof” he did provide has been widely debunked by numerous experts including [Patrick McKenzie](https://github.com/patio11/wrightverification/blob/master/README.md), [Dan Kaminsky](https://dankaminsky.com/2016/05/02/validating-satoshi-or-not/) and [Robert Graham](https://blog.erratasec.com/2016/05/satoshi-how-craig-wrights-deception.html).
