# Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

**Early draft by Jeremy Clark (Concordia University)**

**Open to collaboration**

------

The cryptocurrency Bitcoin was created by an individual, or collection of individuals, using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. In October 2008, Satoshi released a whitepaper describing the Bitcoin protocol. A few months later, he released a software package for running the protocol. He then spent around two years maintaining the software, communicating with developers, and promoting the project over email, mailing lists, online forums and IRC. After two years, Satoshi unceremoniously promoted Gavin Andresen to lead developer and left the project.

Against Satohsi's best wishes ("I wish you wouldn’t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle"), the media has been captivated by the question of who Satoshi really is. Many guesses, with varying degrees of journalistic evidence, have been made in print by reputable journalists working for the *New York Times*, *Newsweek*, *The New Yorker*, *Wired*, *Forbes*, *Fast Company*, and others. A few notable examples are provided in the Table above, along with primary basis (beyond basic demographics and technical expertise) for their conclusion. Each type of evidence will be examined later in this article.

## Why should we care?

Generally, academics have maintained an aversion to the subject of Satoshi's identity, chalking up endeavours to uncover it as gossip, speculation, and not in the realm of science. Our position is that the subject of Satoshi matters to enough people (see table below) that academics should no longer remain quiet. This article does not affirm new attempts to de-anonymize Satoshi. Rather we believe those with relevant expertise can help establish rules of evidence and ensure that weak evidence is not left unquestioned. 

| Who Cares?       | Example                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Candidates       | D. Nakamoto was subjected to a "media frenzy" after being suggested. H. Finney (then quadriplegic with late stage ALS) was extorted and when he did not pay, was swatted at home.[^1] |
| Friends & Family | Families of more than one candidate, in particular candidates who are no longer living, report unwelcome inquiries from Bitcoin enthusiasts. |
| Investors        | A business deal between nCrypt and C. Wright was reported to be contingent on Wright being able to prove claim of being Satoshi. |
| Retail Investors | Some users report investing savings in blockchain technologies and tokens associated with Satoshi candidates. |
| Experts          | Experts (e.g., G. Andresen & N. Courtois) have been retained to assess a candidate's claim to being Satoshi and to serve as expert witnesses (e.g.,  S. Meiklejohn) in legal matters. |
| Courts           | A six week trial gave legal consideration to ownership of Bitcoin's technology vis-a-vis whether a candidate is Satoshi; finding the candidate is overwhelmingly not, on balance of probabilities. |
| Journalists      | L. McGrath Goodman reports threats of violence in retaliation for her article identify a Satoshi candidate. |

The main takeaway of this article can be visualized as follows: imagine taking everyone on earth alive in 2008 and placing them in a (hypothetically large) room. We then filtering out candidates based on every detail we know about Satoshi Nakamoto. How many people are left? One? A dozen? The facts known about Satoshi are scarce, sparse, and scant. We argue, you cannot do much better than being left with a small city of candidates, something like Portland. In other words, in the absence of new evidence, it is not worth pursuing Satoshi.

## A preview of the evidence

Journalists (and others) seeking to identify Satoshi Nakamoto will argue about their candidate using a set of evidence (or a "fact pattern)". But the evidence needs to be part of a larger framework to establish if the facts are meaningful, sufficient, and complete. There is also the possibility of bias. Our goal is to outline (1) possible frameworks, (2) possible biases, and (3) possible evidence. A takeaway is that investigators should be more rigours in terms of (1), and guard better against (2), as most of the evidence (3) is not conclusive enough to be relied on alone.

Two types of investigations can be distinguish from each other: "doxing" and "vetting." In a doxing investigation, the investigator finds and proposes a new non-cooperative candidate that does not want to be identified as Satoshi. Such a candidate will not provide new evidence in favour of being Satoshi, but might offer new evidence to suggest they are not. In a vetting investigation, a candidate claims to be Satoshi and is positioned to back up their claim with new evidence. As mentioned, our hypothesis is that there is not enough known about Satoshi today to sufficiently dox him, without discovering new corroborating evidence. However there are types of evidence that can be created by Satoshi (such as issuing digital signatures) that would be close to sufficient in vetting his identity.

A preview of the evidence is given in the table above. The circumstantial evidence is further broken down into its own table below.

We emphasize that we are not yet assessing if any of this evidence is meaningful or convincing or even correct, we are simply cataloguing what others have proposed.

Later in the article, we will walk through each piece of evidence one-by-one. At this time, we want to first discuss frameworks and biases. However by previewing the evidence first, we can illustrate the frameworks and biases with concrete examples pulled from the evidence. 

## Frameworks

| Possible Frameworks | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| MMO                 | Determining the motive, means, and opportunity for creating Bitcoin. |
| Profiling           | Matching a candidate to the predicted psychology of Satoshi. |
| Bayesian inference  | A rule of probability for evaluating evidence.               |
| Guess Who           | A board game that provides a simpler mental model than Bayesian inference. |
| Occam's razor       | Preferring simple explanations to complex ones.              |

Several possible frameworks are listed in the table above. Each is used at least once by a journalist or other investigator. They are not a complete set of frameworks, nor are they a mutually exclusive set of frameworks----an investigator could use any combination of them in addition to other possible methods. However understanding this set of frameworks will help illuminate the momentous nature of the task of identifying Satoshi. 

### MMO framework

An investigator could take an approach used, to some extent, by law enforcement (and to a large extent by law enforcement on TV): establishing the *motive*, *means*, and *opportunity*. 

Satoshi's *motive* for creating Bitcoin is to try an approach not used in other centralized cryptography projects. As noted by Ducrée [Duc22], Satoshi is relatively apolitical. While many early Bitcoin adopters exhibited a fondness for libertarianism and/or a cypherpunk philosophy, Satoshi does not strongly align himself with either. He once marked Bitcoin as "a new territory of freedom," but also lamented those who are so "anti-fiat-money that anything short of gold isn't good enough." Satoshi vocalizes support for the EFF, Tor, and P2P file sharing. The genesis block of Bitcoin includes the quote: "chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks," which is taken as a criticism of bailouts. Such a position aligns with both populism and libertarianism---bailouts were pursued by both the chancellor's left-leaning Labour Party in the UK and the right-leaning Republican Party in the US over the same time-period. Aside from mildly political statements like these, Satoshi sticks to technical discussions. 

*Motive* can also go to anonymity. In a foreword to a popular Bitcoin textbook, Clark [Cla16] considers reasons why Satoshi would choose anonymity at a time when BTC was not even deployed and had no value. Pragmatic reasons could be avoiding legal issues (operators of e-gold pled guilty to financial crimes a few months before Bitcoin's whitepaper) or patent issues (mailing list participants were known to fret about both [Surety patents](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gzz-dev/2003-07/msg00043.html) and [DigiCash patents](http://marc.info/?l=cypherpunks&m=95280154628360&w=2)), while philosophical reasons could include alignment with the cypherpunk movement. For candidates with projects and research papers that are not released anonymously, inconsistency requires justification.

*Means* captures the ability to design and deploy Bitcoin, which requires technical skills like C++ app development, knowledge of cryptography, and the ability to use anonymity technology. As these skills are taken as evidence ("basic expertise" in the Table above), we will discuss these specifically later in the article.

*Opportunity* creates limits on the *time* and *place* of candidates. For Bitcoin, time is an important consideration, while location is largely open as Satoshi interacted solely online with efforts at making tracing infeasible. The circumstantial evidence (in the Table above) does include some location-based facts which we will examine later. Time and place can also eliminate candidates (i.e., provide an alibi). For example, the McGrath Goodman investigation ruled out Nick Szabo for having an incompatible timeline before centring on Dorian Nakamoto [MG20]. Another candidate, Hal Finny, ran in an organized marathon with registration and finish-line photographs at the same time Satoshi Nakamoto was sending emails [Lop23]

### Profiling

On a recent podcast, L. McGrath Goodman defends the methodology used by her and Newsweek in identifying Dorian Nakamoto [MG20] (praised by other journalists as "thorough and convincing" [Hil14]). The main basis she relied on is "profiling" which, like the MMO framework, was developed by law enforcement (pioneered by FBI agent John E. Douglas and popularized by TV shows Mindhunters and Criminal Minds). Investigators develop a psychological profile of the candidate that fits the evidence. For McGrath Goodman, this meant interviewing major Bitcoin developers (she notes it was early enough in Bitcoin history that they were easy to contact and willing to talk) and deducing Satoshi was someone secretive, reclusive, able to maintain confidentiality, and intelligent. When she found Dorian Nakamoto, she felt he matched the profile (his work was classified and his family stated he was secretive about his work). Ducrée [Duc22] also builds a psychological profile of Satoshi, which overlaps with McGrath Goodman, rooted in ingenuity, persistence, motivated by ideals, and confidentiality [MG20]. Even if a profile is right, it is of limited use if it is not specific. Dorian Nakamoto is not the only person in the world to fit the profile. In both cases, these profiles are taken in combination with other forms of evidence (tables above). 

In the case of a candidate that claims to be Satoshi, profiling can be used in two ways. As above, the Satoshi profile can be used to vet the candidate. However, since most people who are not Satoshi do not claim to be Satoshi (even if they happen match the profile or the evidence), candidates should also be vetted against a profile of anti-social behaviour and deception. E.G. Sirer writes in a blog post, "There’s a big difference between a case that has weak evidence and a case where the evidence contains forged elements. The latter requires a full explanation of the forger, their relationship to the story, and should put the entire story at risk. You can’t just look past that inexplicable problem and focus on the rest. The story changes the moment a piece of the evidence is forged. [Sir15]"

### Bayes theorem

The most precise tool for evaluating evidence is Bayes theorem, however its usefulness is limited by its requirement for having probabilities for many of the things around us. Bayesian inference (which is basically the application of Bayes theorem over and over with a sequence of evidence) lets us reason about how the probability that a candidate is Satoshi, Pr["Alice is Satoshi"], changes as new evidence is evaluated. Consider a *worked example*: we know an IP address that seems to be Satoshi's from Los Angeles. Assume Alice was living in Sherman Oaks on 10 Jan 2009. Does this fact increase or decrease the probability that Alice is Satoshi Nakamoto? And by how much? What if, additionally, Alice is a cryptographer?

The process needs a starting probability, called the *prior* or *baseline*, which is the probability that Alice is Satoshi given you know nothing else about her. We could take the prior to be 1 in 7 billion assuming Alice and Satoshi are both humans alive in 2008. 

The output of the first evaluation of evidence is an updated probability that "Alice is Satoshi" *given* that "Alice lived in Sherman Oaks." Mathematically: Pr["Alice is Satoshi" | "Alice lived in Sherman Oaks"] is called the *posterior*. To figure out if posterior will increase or decrease, by a little or by a lot, we need two more probabilities. The first is the probability that Alice, as a random human alive in 2008, happens to live there: Pr["Alice lived in Sherman Oaks"]; called the *marginal probability*. Imagine a world where everyone in the world lives in Sherman Oaks, then the fact that both Alice and Satoshi have a tie to the region does not help Alice's prospects of being Satoshi much. Conversely, in a world where almost no one lives there, this could be a significant piece of evidence. How many people lived in Sherman Oaks in 2008? Around 50,000. So Pr["Alice lived in Sherman Oaks"]=50,000/7,000,000,000=0.0007%.

So far this has nothing to do with Satoshi, which is why we need the second value called the *likelihood* which is critical to think about whether or not you are formally applying Bayesian inference. It says: assume that Alice is actually Satoshi. What is the probability that Alice will live in Sherman Oaks, given she is Satoshi. In other words, how much more likely is it that Satoshi lives in Sherman Oaks than a random person does (which is 0.0007%). If he is more likely to live there than the average person, this helps Alice's prospects of being Satoshi. If he is less likely than the average person, it hurts her prospects. The degree to which it helps or hurts is the ratio between them: Pr["Alice lived in Sherman Oaks" | "Alice is Satoshi"]/Pr["Alice lived in Sherman Oaks"]. This ratio acts as a scalar that boosts (when the ratio is greater than 1) or diminishes (when the ratio is less than 1) the *prior* probability.

So what is the number? If Satoshi is as likely to live anywhere in the world, it is 0.0007%. But we know Satoshi operated in timezone that fits California's timezone better than, say, Japan. We also have a link between Satoshi and an IP address from the greater LA area (detailed later in the article), which includes Sherman Oaks. This IP address might not be Satoshi's, it could be a proxy for Satoshi, it could also be that he was travelling there and does not live there. And it could have been from an area near, but not exactly, Sherman Oaks. 

Some of these factors are hard to quantify. However, remarkably, Bayesian inference works well with estimates (e.g., super-forecasting, author of Death Note script, criminal allegations against Judge Kavanaugh). If rough numbers go into the model, you will of course get a rough outputs, but approximate probabilities can still be useful: the difference between an output of .01% or 60% can help build intuition for how far evidence can take you. 

To help incorporate the timing of Satoshi's activities, assume the following:

* 4%: random timezone is UTC-8 (1/24).
* 8%: Satoshi's timezone is UTC-8 based on timestamp evidence, as follows: assume UTC-5 is Satoshi's most likely timezone for Jan 2009 and assume moving over a timezone (in either direction) follows a bell curve (binomial distribution with p=0.5).

* 0.0014%: Updated probability Satoshi lives in Sherman Oaks (compared to prior of 0.0007%).

To help incorporate that Satoshi accidentally disclosed his IP address which was assigned by an ISP in the greater LA region, assume the following:

* 10%: Sherman Oaks residents that use an internet device with this ISP.
* 20,000: non-residents of Sherman Oaks that also use this ISP (could reside elsewhere in LA or could be tourists).
* 20%: Resulting probability that the holder of this IP address lives in Sherman Oaks.
* 75%: Probability that Satoshi is the holder of this IP address.
* 5.4%: Updated probability that Satoshi lived in Sherman Oaks (compared to prior of 0.0014%).

Putting this together, what is the probability that Alice is Satoshi given that Alice lives in Sherman Oaks? The prior is 1 in 7 billion (Alice is Satoshi based on nothing?), the marginal probability is 0.0007% (Alice lives in Sherman Oaks based on nothing?), and the likelihood is 5.4% (Alice lives in Sherman Oaks if she is Satoshi?). The result is 0.0001% or 1 in 10,000.

Now assume Alice knows has a moderate level of knowledge in cryptography. We can ask how this improves her chances of being Satoshi by assuming the following:

* 1,000,000: number of people in the world who understand hash functions and digital signatures. This number is hard to estimate. There are 100,000 CISSP certified professionals who write an exam covering cryptography. There are 10,000 computer scientist graduates *a year* globally, many who take at least one crypto course. There are also many kinds of IT people without a CS degree or a CISSP certification that understand cryptography.

* 100%: assume Alice is actually Satoshi, what is the probability she understands cryptography?

Applying Bayes theorem, the previous prior is 1 in 10,000 (Alice is Satoshi based on evidence so far), the marginal probability is 1 in 1,000,000 (Alice is a cryptographer based on nothing?), and the likelihood is 100% (Alice is a cryptographer if she is Satoshi?). The result is 0.75% or 1 in 133. 

The next best evidence is C++ but the overlap between crypto expertise and C++ expertise is likely to be substantial (we ignore the overlap between crypto knowledge and living in Sherman Oaks).

### Guess who?

Bayesian inference is powerful and can be used informally to reason about candidates without numbers, but we can consider a simplification of it. Consider the board game "Guess Who" (if unfamiliar, see short explanation on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F)). Imagine playing the game with 6 billion faces instead of 24 faces. If you used a sequence of questions, each eliminating half of the remaining candidates, how many questions would you have to ask to find Satoshi? 33 questions. If each question eliminated 90% of the candidates, 10 questions would be sufficient.

The simplifying assumption Guess Who makes about Bayesian inference is that faces are fully flipped up or flipped down, there is no in between. You can ask your playing partner, does the candidate know C++? This is a great question that could flip down more than 99.98% of the faces, albeit the playing partner needs to treat "knowing C++" as a binary yes/no, ignoring that real people "know" C++ at different levels (e.g., one might know C without specifically knowing C++ but by knowing C, they do know something about C++). A followup could be: does the candidate know cryptography? This question is a great opening question but is less great of a followup question because of the large overlap of people knowing both C++ and cryptography (both are covered in a typical computer science degree).

After these opening questions, we run out of hard evidence and have to ask speculative questions about typing patterns, ties to London or California, approximate ages... things that we do not know for certain which risks either flipping the real Satoshi down or asking questions so vague that they flip nearly no one down. We simply do not have 10 good questions to ask about Satoshi in a sequence would each flip down 90% of the faces that remain after the previous question.  

ZeMing Gao utilizes this reasoning in an informal blog post purporting a mathematical proof that Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto [Gao21]. We know that Wright is indeed not Satoshi Nakamoto, based on a legal trial in which Gao testified as an expert witness. Gao outlines in theory both Bayesian inference and what we call the Guess Who method but does not run numbers; remarking, "a graduate student could do an actual Satoshi Nakamoto Bayesian modeling for a thesis; but I already know the result." He does list 15 questions that could be used in Guess Who. Consider the first two,

>1. How many people in the world are known to be related to at least the earliest stage of Bitcoin development and also skilled in the programming language Forth (the requisite language used for Bitcoin script designing)? (Answer: exactly one)
>
>2. How many people in the world are known to be related to at least the earliest stage of Bitcoin and also had worked extensively on digital cash and gaming systems for years before Bitcoin’s release? (Answer: exactly one)

Already these questions are problematic: (1) Satoshi tried not to have his identity tied to Bitcoin's development; (2) Forth specifically is not requisite, just stack-based languages, while C++ is paramount (Wright presumedly does not know C++ as, under oath at trial, he failed to explain any line of Bitcoin's code or even be able to describe what a uint is); (3) the questions are not independent as they repeat the same first clause; and (4) Satoshi might not had worked on digital cash or gaming before Bitcoin.

### Occam's razor

Occam's razor is a heuristic that encourages investigators to decide between two potential explanations by preferring the simpler one. Occam's razor is a heuristic without a mathematical basis. Bayes Theorem sometimes also prefers a simpler hypothesis because simple tends to have a high ratio between likelihood and marginal likelihood, but it is not strictly the case.

Clark [Cla16] considers if Satoshi is a single individual or is a team of individuals. He concludes that the years of self-consistent communication across multiple platforms and times is simpler for a single individual than a group of individuals. Others consider candidates, such as Hal Finney or Gavin Andresen, who are well-known collaborators of Satoshi with volumes of public correspondence. Were Hal Finney, it would be simpler for Hal to not engage with Satoshi or Bitcoin at all, rather than drawing attention to himself and fabricating fake correspondence. While these deductions might seem sensible, Occam's razor can be taken further than most would accept. For example, McGrath Goodman in *Newsweek* deduces Satoshi Nakamoto is the real name of Satoshi [MG20]—indeed a simpler explanation than it being a pseudonym (and proposed Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, 1 of 3 Satoshi Nakamoto's living in the US at the time [Hil14], as the candidate ).

Investigations in Satoshi's identity can be subverted by subtle biases the investigator might not realize they are making. A preview of them are in the Table above, and below we detail each one. This is not meant to be a complete set of biases, however these are the five that we were able to notice when we critically examined existing Satoshi investigations. 

### Streetlight effect

Consider the following parable, as quoted (via Wikipedia) from [Fre10]:

> A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where the light is."

When looking for a Satoshi candidate, it is impossible to consider every human on earth. Therefore investigations often start with a shortlist of candidates based on some easy-to-apply criteria. Examples include: "people named Satoshi Nakamoto" [*Newsweek*], "people who talked about digital cash before Bitcoin in text that is searchable online" [*New York Times*], "people who used a particular phrase like 'computationally impractical to reverse' in text that is searchable online" [*Fast Company*], or "people who attended *CRYPTO* 2011" [*The New Yorker*]. Does the real Satoshi fit any or all of these criteria? Bayesian analysis would command us to think about the sheer number of people left out by this kind of selection criteria, and suggest that much larger crowd is where you would more likely find Satoshi. 

To illuminate, consider one of these examples. Joshua Davis writes in *The New Yorker*:

> [Stuart] Haber [co-author of the linked time-stamping system cited in Bitcoin's whitepaper] noted that the community of cryptographers is very small: about three hundred people a year attend the most important conference, the annual gathering in Santa Barbara. In all likelihood, Nakamoto belonged to this insular world. If I wanted to find him, the Crypto 2011 conference would be the place to start.

Satoshi may indeed have been at *CRYPTO* in 2011, but the field of cryptography is not as small as implied. *CRYPTO* is a niche academic event, specialized in highly technical documents with full formal proofs, usually leaning toward theoretical—basically everything the Bitcoin whitepaper is not. Attendance for 2011 is reported at 412 people. This alone is a small fraction of the 9148 authors who have published at least one paper through the IACR (the organization behind *CRYPTO*), including "eprints" that are not peer-reviewed. The 9148 number omits all the people with cryptography experience who have never published a paper via IACR—e.g., undergraduate students, developers, government employees, and hobbyists. 21 of the 25 developers listed as important contributors to Bitcoin Core by the Bitcoin Wiki[^2] have never published via IACR. 

Assume for every 1 person with an IACR paper there are another 10 with a moderate level of competency in cryptography. Then *CRYPTO* 2011 was a mere 0.4% of the community of cryptographers. It is rather absurd for a reporter to go to there, circle the names of the only 9 participants based in/near the UK (based on Satoshi using a quote from the Times of London and ignoring the California IP address), eliminate those who dislike Bitcoin or do not know C++, and, *viola*, the one name left: Trinity College Dublin graduate student Michael Clear is Satoshi Nakamoto (Clear denies it, stating "even limited searches yield candidates who fit the profile far better than I think I do." [Cle13]).

We must contend with the fact that Satoshi might have never published anything tied to cryptography, C++, or peer-to-peer networking online. He might never have risen in prominence in any field that is easily tied to Bitcoin. There is a complexity and ingenuity to Bitcoin that requires high intelligence, but this is not the same as an easy-to-identify social profile. Consider another groundbreaking open source project: the operating system kernel Linux. Its inventor, Linus Torvalds, has since risen in profile but when he actually developed Linux 1.0, he was a low-profile graduate student in Finland without much of a digital trace on the subject of free and open source operating systems. 

An additional challenge for the streetlight effect is Satoshi's anonymity. Almost by definition, candidates who find themselves in the "streetlight" are there because they put their name on their ideas and accomplishments. Self-consistency is an issue for many Satoshi candidates who refuse to put their name on Bitcoin, but have no qualms putting their name on similar technologies like bit gold, Mixmaster, and Hashcash. 

### Cherry-picking and salience bias

Many Satoshi arguments are anecdotes about the candidate such as the following:

> *When Satoshi created Bitcoin, Alice was a graduate student in cryptography at the University of Waterloo (coincidentally when Vitalik Buterin, a creator of Ethereum, was there as an undergrad). The university is the main hub for elliptic curve cryptography. Alice was taught in high school to double-space after periods and being Canadian, uses spellings and colloquialisms of the British commonwealth. At the time, Alice worked with David Chaum, the cryptography pioneer who invented digital cash and lived in Sherman Oaks, California (Alice's whereabouts in Jan 2009 are unaccounted for). When Satoshi took a long break from active development on Bitcoin, Alice was preparing to run the world's first cryptographically secure election in Nov 2009 using a system called Scantegrity with Chaum, Ronald Rivest, and others (later in 2011, Scantegrity would record election data in Bitcoin's blockchain). Alice's other research subjects included time-stamping through stock data found in a newspaper, financial modelling, and her masters thesis topic was on Tor, the anonymity software used by Satoshi to hide his IP address. Alice's research was discussed widely, including on the cryptography mailing list in Dec 2007.*

While the name has been changed, this in fact describes a real person (an author of this article). The description sounds convincing and casual readers of newspaper might think Satoshi has finally been found. They would be wrong: Alice was not proficient in C++, only coding in Mathematica and Java at the time. Despite being taught to double-space after a period, she ignored the advice. While Alice grew up in "grey" county, Alice does not (nor do Canadians generally) say "bloody" or "maths." And the list of missed evidence goes on. Generally anecdotes like this tend to emphasize matching details (the *cherries* being picked) and fail to comment on the details that do not match.

Additionally, some evidence (such as cryptography or C++ proficiency) are strong requirements, while other evidence (such as a tie to Japan due to the name Satoshi Nakamoto) are less important, with alternative explanations that are easy to make. Consider the case where a witness testified to walking in on a Satoshi candidate dressed like a ninja (implying a connection to the Japanese name). The same candidate had earlier failed, under oath, to explain what a uint is in C++. If the first detail is more memorable, memorable, interesting, and vivid (i.e., *salient*), while the second is more important to the case, it would be biased to emphasize the first. 

### Unfalsifiable subterfuge [tk]

The main issue with cherrypicking is what to be done. 

It is commonly held that certain facts about Satoshi Nakamoto are fake, such as the name Satoshi Nakamoto or the birthdate provided by Satoshi when registering an online account. 

> Many people point to the fact that there are conversational email threads back and forth between Hal Finney and Satoshi Nakamoto as the main reason why it simply can't be Hal. From my standpoint, that is exactly why it is Hal. If Hal Finney was going to create the Satoshi Nakamoto character, the best thing he could do to throw people off the scent of it being him is to send the emails back and forth. (V. Armani quoted in [Kem23]).

> If I had forged that document, then it would be perfect. (Craig Wright)



A common belief is that Satoshi Nakomoto is a pseudonym and not Satoshi's real name. The birthdate provided by Satoshi is another detail that could be fake. Other details are not sure 

* Imagine Alice's license place is observed on a car seen peeling away from a bank robbery. Bob says, "Well, that proves that Alice *didn't* rob the bank." Bob responds to your puzzled look, "Alice would not be so stupid to use her own car. If you saw her license plate, that means she didn't do it!" 

* Subterfuge: this we need to think about. Should be British, because bloody and times of london. BUT IF YOU WRE SATOSHI, wouldn’t you exactly want to do that to throw people off? Wouldn’t you want to converse with yourself (Hal)? Best way for Hal to hide being Satoshi is to go wholehog into Bitcoin (as oppose to never mention it ever?), an opperate as a sockpuppet for Satoshi?

  

### Base-rate neglect  [tk]

Imagine a medical test that determines if someone has a really rare disease. Say it is so rare that only one person on earth has it. Say the medical test in 99.99% accurate and we somehow manage to test everyone on earth with it. Everyone who tests positive is put in a room. That room will include the person who has it but it will also include many people with a false test result. How many? In fact, the will not fit in a room. It will be 700,000, similar in number to all the people living in Portland. Put a different way, let's say Alice tests positive. What is the probability she actually has the disease? It is infinitesimal at well under one-thousandth of one percent. This is counter-intuitive as Kahneman and Tversky demonstrated by creating similar scenarios for experts (like doctors) to study—they routinely thought positive tests were a strong (but not perfect) indication of having the disease (this was part of a research program that was awarded a Noble prize in 2002).

Recall the *prior* or *base-rate* is one portion of Bayesian inference. If this number is small (such 1 in 7 billion for Satoshi), the evidence must be very persuasive to move it toward 100%. The types of things known about Satoshi are somewhat specific (C++ proficiency, cryptography expertise, word choice, suspected locations) but they are like the 99.99% accurate test: they fail to pick Satoshi out of a haystack that includes the global population.

### Basic expertise  [tk]

> "In general, professors typically have a fairly narrow expertise, and uncovering secret identities is not one of them... But all professors have one particular skill: to be able to size up someone’s technical understanding and characterize where he or she has technical misconceptions." EGS

* “Kaminsky ticked off the skills Nakamoto would need to pull it off. “He’s a world-class programmer, with a deep understanding of the C++ programming language,” he said. “He understands economics, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. Either there’s a team of people who worked on this,” Kaminsky said, “or this guy is a genius.” Source

* “The idiosyncratic construction of Bitcoin’s code also suggests that Satoshi had an academic background. It has been described as “brilliant but sloppy”, eschewing conventional software development practices like unit testing but exhibiting cutting-edge security architecture and an expert understanding of academic cryptography and economics.” Source

### Access to web accounts

Satoshi used a variety of accounts for web-based email including:  satoshi@anonymousspeech.com (Aug 2008–), satoshi@vistomail.com (Oct 2009–), satoshin@gmx.com (April 2009–), and. He maintained accounts at sourceforge (at least two) and accounts at online forums, such as one at the P2P Foundation message board (registered with the gmx email account). This latter account was used to post "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" on 7 Mar 2014 (the day after the *Newsweek* article on Dorian Nakamoto, and around 3 years after Satoshi's last known communication). Later in Fall 2014, the gmx account was determined to have been hijacked [McG14]. It is unknown if the hijacking started before or after the Dorian post (access to the email address was sufficient to reset the P2P Foundation account), how the hijacking occurred exactly, or to what extent Satoshi had wiped the account's contents before it was compromised. As of 10 years later, no new information about Satoshi's identity or early communications has become public as a result of this compromise.

For vetting someone claiming to be Satoshi, the production of early unknown communications (confirmed by the other parties to it) would be strong evidence. The possibility and observations of account compromises increase the marginal likelihood of this evidence, so it cannot be conclusive that the communication is being produced by Satoshi, as opposed an imposture who gained access to the accounts, however it is still highly suggestive evidence. 

### Anecdotal evidence  [tk]

* Andresen recently walked back his position: “I now know it was a mistake to trust Craig Wright as much as I did. I regret getting sucked into the ‘who is (or isn’t) Satoshi’ game,” he wrote in February 2023 in a [revision](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi) to an earlier blog post.

> I can't help but wonder if Linux was released under a pseudonym, would anyone guess that it was written by a Finnish masters student? Someone that was otherwise unknown? Of course not. Someone would compare the writing to Richard Stallman, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and some super random patent holders, and declare Stallman the winner. Then Newsweek would find him at the end of his driveway, annoyed and in a crumpled t-shirt, chewing on something he pulled off his foot. :)



### Circumstantial evidence



> But the point of this column isn’t to claim we found Satoshi Nakamoto. It’s to show how circumstantial evidence, which is what the *New Yorker* based its conclusions on, isn’t synonymous with truth. I doubt the *New Yorker* found the right guy. I also believe that our evidence is far more compelling, yet we also probably haven’t nailed it either. [Pen11]

* Aware of linked timestamping and hashcash; unaware initially of b-money, bit gold, and reusable proof of work (RPOW).

* Most citations are relevant or provenance (conversations about citing specific papers)

  Citation [2] is a curious case:

  * A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post [2-5].
  * To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7] [2] [5]

* The first instance of the citation is not that interesting, it is included in a blanket of 4 papers about time-stamping without anything specific about the paper. The second instance is interesting as Satoshi deliberately excludes [3] and [4] from the idea of using a Merkle Tree [7], while noting that Haber & Stornetta's earlier works [2] and [5] do not. This convinces me that Satoshi knows more than the title of [2] and knows some details of it. Unlike modern academic papers, a copy of [2] is not available online and is only available in print. Further, it is a regional conference (Netherlands and Belgium) and its proceedings are not widely disseminated. It also was not a well-cited paper (before Bitcoin popularized it) and was one of several papers put out by researchers affiliated with the TIMESEC project from KU/UC Leuven.

* So probably either: (i) Satoshi obtained a paper copy of it and read it; or (ii) he read an uncited paper that in turn cited [2] and he copied the citation. In case (i), it is also interesting that An overview of the conference (1980--2023) is available and includes small (~1 page) summaries of electronic payments, followed by time-stamping. The latter cites [2] but nothing else in it seems tied to Satoshi's writings.
