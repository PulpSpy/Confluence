# Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

###### Early draft by Jeremy Clark (Concordia University)

###### Open to collaboration

------

The cryptocurrency Bitcoin was created by an individual, or collection of individuals, using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. In October 2018, Satoshi released a whitepaper describing the Bitcoin protocol. A few months later, he released a software package for running the protocol. He then spent around two years maintaining the software, communicating with users over email, and promoting the currency in online forums. After two years, Satoshi unceremoniously promoted Gavin Andresen to lead developer and left the project.

The media has been captivated by the question of who Satoshi really is. Many guesses, with varying degrees of journalistic evidence, have been made in print by reputable journalists working for the New York Times, Newsweek, The New Yorker, Wired, Forbes, Fast Company, and others. A few notable examples are provided in the Table above, along with primary basis (beyond basic demographics and expertise) for their conclusion. These types of evidence will be explored later in the paper.

| Who Cares?       | Example                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Candidates       | D. Nakamoto was subjected to a "media frenzy" after being reported. |
| Friends & Family | Families of more than one candidate, in particular candidates who are no longer living, report unwelcome inquiries from Bitcoin enthusiasts. |
| Investors        | A business deal between nCrypt and C. Wright was reported to be contingent on Wright being able to prove claim of being Satoshi. |
| Retail Investors | Some people make investments in blockchain technologies associated with Satoshi candidates. |

Generally, academics have maintained an aversion to the subject of Satoshi's identity, chalking up endeavours to uncover it as gossip, speculation, and not in the realm of science. Our position is that the subject of Satoshi matters to enough people (see table above) that academics should not remain quiet. We do not affirm new attempts to de-anonymize Satoshi. Rather we believe those with relevant expertise can help establish rules of evidence and ensure that weak evidence is not left unquestioned.

## Investigative Methods

Journalists (and others) seeking to identify Satoshi Nakamoto will argue about their candidate using a set of evidence (or "fact pattern)". But the evidence need to be part of a larger framework to establish if the facts are meaningful, sufficient, and complete. There is also the possibility of bias. Our goal is to outline (1) possible frameworks, (2) possible biases, and (3) possible evidence. A takeaway is that journalists (and others) should be more rigours in terms of (1), and guard better against (2), as most of the evidence (3) is not conclusive enough to be relied on alone.

It is also important to distinguish between "doxing" and "vetting" investigations. In a doxing investigation, the journalist is finding and proposing a candidate that does not want to be identified as Satoshi. This candidate will not provide new evidence that could help prove they are Satoshi, but might offer new evidence to suggest they are not. In a vetting investigation, the candidate is claiming to be Satoshi and therefore is positioned to back up their claim with new evidence. A takeaway from our paper is that there is not enough known about Satoshi to sufficiently dox him without new collaborating evidence. However there are types of evidence that can be created by Satoshi that would be close to sufficient in vetting his identity.

Later in the article, we will walk through each piece of evidence one-by-one. At this time, we want to first discuss frameworks and biases. However providing a preview of the evidence will allow us to illustrate the frameworks and biases with concrete examples pulled from the evidence. 

### Frameworks

| Possible Frameworks | Explanation                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| MMO                 | Determining the motive, means, and opportunity for creating Bitcoin |
| Profiling           | Matching a candidate to the predicted psychology of Satoshi  |
| Bayesian inference  | A rule of probability for evaluating evidence                |
| Guess who           | A board game that provides a simpler mental model than Bayesian inference |
| Occam's razor       | Preferring simple explanations to complex ones               |

Several possible frameworks are listed in the table above. Each is used at least once by a journalist or other investigator. They are not a complete set of frameworks, nor are they are not a mutually exclusive set of frameworks----an investigator could use any combination of them in addition to other possible methods. However understanding this set of frameworks will help illustrate the momentous nature of the task of identifying Satoshi. 

### MMO Framework

An investigator could take an approach used, to some extent, by law enforcement (and to a large extent by law enforcement on TV): establishing the *motive*, *means*, and *opportunity*. 

Satoshi's *motive* for creating Bitcoin is to try an approach not used in other centralized cryptography projects. As noted by Ducrée [Duc22], Satoshi is relatively apolitical. While many early Bitcoin adopters exhibited a fondness for libertarianism and/or a cypherpunk philosophy, Satoshi does not strongly align himself with either. He once marked Bitcoin as "a new territory of freedom." The genesis block of Bitcoin includes the quote: "chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks," which is taken as a criticism of bailouts. Such a position aligns with both populism and libertarianism---bailouts were pursued by both the chancellor's left-leaning Labour Party in the UK and the right-leaning Republican Party in the US over the same time-period. Aside from mildly political statements like these, Satoshi sticks to technical discussions. 

*Motive* can also go to anonymity. In a foreword to a popular Bitcoin textbook, Clark [Cla16] considers reasons why Satoshi would choose anonymity at a time when BTC was not even deployed and had no value. Pragmatic reasons could be avoiding legal issues (operators of e-gold pled guilty to financial crimes a few months before Bitcoin's whitepaper) or patent issues (mailing list participants were known to fret about both [Surety patents](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gzz-dev/2003-07/msg00043.html) and [DigiCash patents](http://marc.info/?l=cypherpunks&m=95280154628360&w=2)), while philosophical reasons could include alignment with the cypherpunk movement. Satoshi once stated, "I wish you wouldn’t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle." For candidates with projects and research papers that are not released anonymously, inconsistency requires justification.

*Means* captures the ability to design and deploy Bitcoin, which requires technical skills like C++ app development, knowledge of cryptography, and the ability to use anonymity technology. As these skills are taken as evidence ("basic expertise" in the Table above), we will discuss these specifically later in the article.

*Opportunity* creates limits on the *time* and *place* of candidates. For Bitcoin, time is an important consideration, while location is largely open as Satoshi interacted solely online with efforts at making tracing infeasible. The circumstantial evidence (in the Table above) does include some location-based facts which we will examine later. Time and place can also eliminate candidates (i.e., provide an alibi). For example, the McGrath-Goodman investigation ruled out Nick Szabo for having an incompatible timeline before centring on Dorian Nakamoto [tkcite]. Another candidate, Hal Finny, ran in an organized marathon with registration and finish-line photographs at the same time Satoshi Nakamoto was sending emails [tkcite].

### Profiling

On a recent podcast, L. McGrath Goodman defends the methodology used by her and Newsweek in identifying Dorian Nakamoto [tkcite]. The main basis she relied on is "profiling" which, like the MMO framework, was developed by law enforcement (pioneered by FBI agent John E. Douglas and popularized by TV shows Mindhunters and Criminal Minds). Investigators develop a psychological profile of the candidate that fits the evidence. For McGrath Goodman, this meant interviewing major Bitcoin developers (she notes it was early enough in Bitcoin history that they were easy to contact and willing to talk) and deducing Satoshi was someone secretive, reclusive, able to maintain confidentiality, and intelligent. When she found Dorian Nakamoto, she felt he matched the profile (his work was classified and his family stated he was secretive about his work). Ducrée [Duc22] also builds a psychological profile of Satoshi, which overlaps with McGrath Goodman, rooted in ingenuity, persistence, motivated by ideals, and confidentiality []. Even if a profile is right, it is of limited use if it is not specific. Dorian Nakamoto is not the only person in the world to fit the profile. In both cases, these profiles are taken in combination with other forms of evidence (tables above).

In the case of a candidate that claims to be Satoshi, profiling can be used in two ways. As above, the Satoshi profile can be used to vet the candidate. However, since most people who are not Satoshi do not claim to be Satoshi (even if they happen match the profile or the evidence), candidates should also be vetted against a profile of anti-social behaviour and deception. E.G. Sirer writes in a blog post, "There’s a big difference between a case that has weak evidence and a case where the evidence contains forged elements. The latter requires a full explanation of the forger, their relationship to the story, and should put the entire story at risk. You can’t just look past that inexplicable problem and focus on the rest. The story changes the moment a piece of the evidence is forged. [tkcite]"

### Bayes Theorem

The most precise tool for evaluating evidence is Bayes theorem, however its usefulness is limited by our ability to generate probabilities for many of the things around us. Bayes theorem is often used loosely (e.g., Superforecasting, author of Death Note script, criminal allegations against Judge Kavanaugh)

Model Comparison and Occam's Razor

Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto

https://coingeek.com/a-mathematical-proof-that-craig-s-wright-is-satoshi-nakamoto/

https://zemgao.com/a-mathematical-proof-that-craig-s-wright-is-satoshi-nakamoto/







Given a theory t and pieces of evidence e1, e2, and e3, what is new probably of t being correct?



Pr[ t | e ] = ell * Pr[t]



Pr[t] is called the prior or baseline probability. It is the probability that t is true before you consider the evidence. It is a common fallacy to not appreciate the significance the prior has on the result. Given a very low prior (e.g., super rare disease), even with strong evidence (a positive result from an accurate test), the probability of t (that you have the disease) might stay small.



Pr[t|e] is called the posterior probability. It is the “updated” value of Pr[t] after considering the evidence.



ell is a scaling function that will increase, decrease, or not impact Pr[t] depending on how supportive the evidence is for t. 



ell is not a probability itself. If ell=0, then the probability goes to zero and t and e are mutually exclusive. If ell is between 0 and 1, the probability of t decreases (thus e does not support t). If ell is exactly 1, then t and e are independent. If ell is between 1 and a max value we’ll call max for now, then the probability of t increases (thus e supports t). If ell is max, then the probability goes to 1 (certainty) and e proves t. 



What is max? Well, it is a bit ugly because Pr[t|e] is a probability and thus can only go to one. So it is going to be some ratio between Pr[t|e] and Pr[t]. Specifically it is 1/Pr[t]. 



== Liklihood



So how do we compute ell? It requires us to know something about the evidence e, its probability and how it is linked to t. There are a few formulations of ell (obviously equivalent) that depend on what you want to estimate to compute it.



Variant 1: ell( Pr[e|t], Pr[e]) = Pr[e|t]/Pr[e]

Variant 2: ell( Pr[e|t], Pr[e|!t] ) = Pr[e|t]/(Pr[e|t]*Pr[t] + Pr[e|!t]*Pr[!t])



Pr[e] - the probability of seeing the evidence (marginal probability)

Pr[e|t] - assuming the theory is true, what is the probability this evidence will come to light (likelihood)

Pr[e|!t] - assuming the theory is not true, what is the probability this evidence will come to light



In terms of a filter, Pr[e|!t] is the probability of a false positive and 1-Pr[e|!t] is the true negatives. Pr[e|t] is the true positives and 1-Pr[e|t] is the probability of a false negative. 



Example: probability email is spam because spam filter labels it spam. Key influences (variant 2):

1. the probability of spam in the first place: if spam is super rare, the probability this is spam is low
2. the probability of spam being labeled spam (accuracy or true positive)
3. the probability of non-spam being mislabeled as spam (false positive)



Note: It is tempting to think Pr[e|t] + Pr[e|!t] = Pr[e]. This is not the case:

Pr[e|t]*Pr[t] + Pr[e|!t]*Pr[!t] = Pr[e]



Example: probability the coin will flip heads given it is raining. Say the probability it is raining is 30%. Then the probability it is raining given the coin flips heads is the same as if it flips tails. So Pr[e|t] = Pr[e|!t]. We can consider these two values as a ratio (odds or likelihood ratio): o=Pr[e|t]/Pr[e|!t]. If o=1, e and t are independent. If o>1, then it e supports t. If o<1, then it does not support t.

### Guess Who

### 

One blog post [ZG21] purports a mathematical proof that C. Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, providing both a method and an application of the method. The article is informal and our assessment is that it is ultimately fallacious, but we commend the author for articulating a concrete methodology. After a false start of explaining, but failing to use, Bayes theorem (an appropriate method we address below), it instead uses an approach that we will describe as the "Guess Who" method.

Consider the board game "Guess Who" (if unfamiliar, see short explanation on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F)). Imagine playing the game with 6 billion faces instead of 24 faces. If you used a sequence of questions, each eliminating half of the remaining candidates, how many questions would you have to ask to find Satoshi? 33 questions. If each question eliminated 90% of the candidates, 10 questions would be sufficient.



### Occam's Razor

Clark [Cla16] argues Satoshi is most likely a single individual (Occam's razor is discussed below) as years of communication was self-consistent and displayed deep knowledge of all aspects of Bitcoin.

## Circumstantial evidence

Anecdotes

Many Satoshi arguments are anecdotes about the candidate with cherry-picked circumstantial evidence. An example might read like the following.

When Satoshi created Bitcoin, Alice was a graduate student in cryptography and computer science at the University of Waterloo (overlapping with undergradate Vitalik Buterin, a creator of Ethereum). A high school student up in the 1990s, Alice was taught to double-space after periods; Canadians, part of the British commonwealth, use British spellings and colloquialisms; and as a grad student, Alice maintained an unruly schedule, working late into the night and maintaining a timezone closer to California than Eastern. Alice's research was in cryptography, where she worked with David Chaum, the cryptography pioneer who invented digital cash (working throughout his career with people like Nick Szabo, zooko, Len Sassasan). Her whereabouts are unaccounted for   is uncertain if Alice visited Chaum in 20XX, who lived near Van Nuys Blvd in Sherman Oakes, California (IP address). At the time Satoshi wrote he was "moving on to other projects," Alice was preparing... Put results on Bitcoin and wrote 3rd paper on it. Beacons and times of london. Tor Other research subjects including random beacons (using quotes from newspapers to timestamp) and the Tor anonymity network. Lurked and occasionally posted on cryptography mailing list. Later Alice is photographed at the infamous Princeton roundtable. Windows Vista. Libertarian. ECC

Sounds pretty good right? Well, consider the following:

Bitcoin was written in C++ while Alice's projects were written in Java. Alice did not directly program the application but focused on protocols and prototyping in high level languages like Mathematica. Despite learning to type with two spaces after a period, zero of Alice's prolific online writing demonstrates this hallmark. Never used the term "maths."



“Kaminsky ticked off the skills Nakamoto would need to pull it off. “He’s a world-class programmer, with a deep understanding of the C++ programming language,” he said. “He understands economics, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. Either there’s a team of people who worked on this,” Kaminsky said, “or this guy is a genius.” Source

“The idiosyncratic construction of Bitcoin’s code also suggests that Satoshi had an academic background. It has been described as “brilliant but sloppy”, eschewing conventional software development practices like unit testing but exhibiting cutting-edge security architecture and an expert understanding of academic cryptography and economics.” Source

  Privacy, IEEE Computer Society, pages 122-133, April 1980.

The first instance of the citation is not that interesting, it is included in a blanket of 4 papers about time-stamping without anything specific about the paper. The second instance is interesting as Satoshi deliberately excludes [3] and [4] from the idea of using a Merkle Tree [7], while noting that Haber & Stornetta's earlier works [2] and [5] do not. This convinces me that Satoshi knows more than the title of [2] and knows some details of it. Unlike modern academic papers, a copy of [2] is not available online and is only available in print. Further, it is a regional conference (Netherlands and Belgium) and its proceedings are not widely disseminated. It also was not a well-cited paper (before Bitcoin popularized it) and was one of several papers put out by researchers affiliated with the TIMESEC project from KU/UC Leuven.

 So probably either: (i) Satoshi obtained a paper copy of it and read it; or (ii) he read an uncited paper that in turn cited [2] and he copied the citation. In case (i), it is also interesting that An overview of the conference (1980--2023) is available and includes small (~1 page) summaries of electronic payments, followed by time-stamping. The latter cites [2] but nothing else in it seems tied to Satoshi's writings.

# Rough Notes

##### Leah McGrath Goodman (2020):

* https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-pomp-podcast/id1434060078
* Talked with Gavin
* Profile based on people who emailed with Satoshi
  * Build best profile and interview candidates
  * Bitcoin took two years, study the timeline
  * Excluded Szabo because too busy over the two years 
  * Gavin: Code came from one individual
  * Satoshi emailed Hal and asked for a crash file to debug something; claims IP address for email in California
  * Discussed over email for several weeks before meeting, including correspondence about Bitcoin and a paper wallet from Gavin (so he knew what it was about)
  * Showed up for in-person interview, Dorian clammed up
  * Dorain worked on classified things (aerospace)
  * His brother had a pipebomb put in his car (he survived?) (people thought brother put it there himself)
  * Email said "mountain spring"
  * Family says he is private, think he could have been involved but wouldn't confirm it. Still think he was involved (basically he was sus and so why not bitcoin, but nothing specific to bitcoin)
* Interviewed his family
* Did not expect "the level that went to"
