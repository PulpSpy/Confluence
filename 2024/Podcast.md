Covers the creativity and methodology behind research, rather than the research papers themselves. Sample of questions:

* How many undeveloped research ideas do you have currently? Do you write them down or keep them in your head? If written, how and in what form?
* Where are you when you have a research idea? Are you thinking deliberatively about it? Does it come to you when you are doing something different?
* What kind of tools (software) are important to your workflow? Do you track things? Do you organize? 
* Collaboration: how do you work with students? With outside collaborators? What works? What are some things that do not work?
* Page length
* Peer review, responses, shepherding,
